all 	O

that 	O
there 	O
was 	O
but 	O
one 	O
solitary 	O
bidding 	O

and 	O
that 	O
was 	O
from 	O
an 	O
attorney 	O
connected 	O
with 	O
the 	O
bill-broking 	O
business 	O
, 	O
who 	O
offered 	O
two 	O

and 	O
the 	O
balance 	O
in 	O

Consequently 	O
the 	O

I 	O
was 	O

I 	O
remember 	O

recollect 	O

by 	O
an 	O

five 	O

all 	O
in 	O
halfpence 	O

twopence 	O

as 	O
it 	O

any 	O

that 	O
it 	O

It 	O

in 	O
vain 	O
