The O
Arrival O
On O
the O
24th O
of O
February O
, O
1815 O
, O
the O
look-out O
at O
Notre-Dame O
de O
la O
Garde O
signalled O
the O
three-master O
, O
the O
_ O
Pharaon O
_ O
from O
Smyrna O
, O
Trieste O
, O
and O
Naples O
. O
As O
usual O
, O
a O
pilot O
put O
off O
immediately O
, O
and O
rounding O
the O
ChÃ¢teau O
dâ€™If O
, O
got O
on O
board O
the O
vessel O
between O
Cape O
Morgion O
and O
Rion O
island O
. O
Immediately O
, O
and O
according O
to O
custom O
, O
the O
ramparts O
of O
Fort O
Saint-Jean O
were O
covered O
with O
spectators O
; O
it O
is O
always O
an O
event O
at O
Marseilles O
for O
a O
ship O
to O
come O
into O
port O
, O
especially O
when O
this O
ship O
, O
like O
the O
_ O
Pharaon O
_ O
, O
has O
been O
built O
, O
rigged O
, O
and O
laden O
at O
the O
old O
Phocee O
docks O
, O
and O
belongs O
to O
an O
owner O
of O
the O
city O
. O
The O
ship O
drew O
on O
and O
had O
safely O
passed O
the O
strait O
, O
which O
some O
volcanic O
shock O
has O
made O
between O
the O
Calasareigne O
and O
Jaros O
islands O
; O
had O
doubled O
PomÃ¨gue O
, O
and O
approached O
the O
harbor O
under O
topsails O
, O
jib O
, O
and O
spanker O
, O
but O
so O
slowly O
and O
sedately O
that O
the O
idlers O
, O
with O
that O
instinct O
which O
is O
the O
forerunner O
of O
evil O
, O
asked O
one O
another O
what O
misfortune O
could O
have O
happened O
on O
board O
. O
However O
, O
those O
experienced O
in O
navigation O
saw O
plainly O
that O
if O
any O
accident O
had O
occurred O
, O
it O
was O
not O
to O
the O
vessel O
herself O
, O
for O
she O
bore O
down O
with O
all O
the O
evidence O
of O
being O
skilfully O
handled O
, O
the O
anchor O
a-cockbill O
, O
the O
jib-boom O
guys O
already O
eased O
off O
, O
and O
standing O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
pilot O
, O
who O
was O
steering O
the O
_ O
Pharaon O
_ O
towards O
the O
narrow O
entrance O
of O
the O
inner O
port O
, O
was O
a O
young O
man O
, O
who O
, O
with O
activity O
and O
vigilant O
eye O
, O
watched O
every O
motion O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
repeated O
each O
direction O
of O
the O
pilot O
. O
The O
vague O
disquietude O
which O
prevailed O
among O
the O
spectators O
had O
so O
much O
affected O
one O
of O
the O
crowd O
that O
he O
did O
not O
await O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
vessel O
in O
harbor O
, O
but O
jumping O
into O
a O
small O
skiff O
, O
desired O
to O
be O
pulled O
alongside O
the O
_ O
Pharaon O
_ O
, O
which O
he O
reached O
as O
she O
rounded O
into O
La O
RÃ©serve O
basin O
. O
When O
the O
young O
man O
on O
board O
saw O
this O
person O
approach O
, O
he O
left O
his O
station O
by O
the O
pilot O
, O
and O
, O
hat O
in O
hand O
, O
leaned O
over O
the O
ship O
's O
bulwarks O
. O
He O
was O
a O
fine O
, O
tall O
, O
slim O
young O
fellow O
of O
eighteen O
or O
twenty O
, O
with O
black O
eyes O
, O
and O
hair O
as O
dark O
as O
a O
raven O
's O
wing O
; O
and O
his O
whole O
appearance O
bespoke O
that O
calmness O
and O
resolution O
peculiar O
to O
men O
accustomed O
from O
their O
cradle O
to O
contend O
with O
danger O
. O
`` O
Ah O
, O
is O
it O
you O
, O
DantÃ¨s I-PERSON
? O
'' O
cried O
the O
man O
in O
the O
skiff O
. O
`` O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
? O
and O
why O
have O
you O
such O
an O
air O
of O
sadness O
aboard O

'' O
`` O
A O
great O
misfortune O

replied O
the O
young O

, O

`` O

`` O

asked O
the O
owner O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
considerable O
resignation O

`` O

'' O
`` O

died O
of O
brain-fever O
in O
dreadful O
agony O

'' O
Then O
turning O
to O
the O
crew O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Bear O
a O
hand O
there O
, O
to O
take O
in O
sail O
! O
'' O
All O
hands O
obeyed O
, O
and O
at O
once O
the O
eight O
or O
ten O
seamen O
who O
composed O
the O
crew O
, O
sprang O
to O
their O
respective O
stations O

the O

The O
young O
sailor O
gave O
a O
look O
to O
see O
that O
his O
orders O
were O
promptly O
and O
accurately O
obeyed O
, O
and O
then O
turned O
again O
to O
the O
owner O
. O
`` O
And O
how O
did O
this O
misfortune O
occur O
? O
'' O
inquired O
the O
latter O
, O
resuming O
the O
interrupted O
conversation O
. O
`` O
Alas O

in O
the O
most O

After O

long O
talk O

harbor-master O
, O
Captain O
Leclere I-PERSON
left O
Naples O
greatly O
disturbed O
in O

In O
twenty-four O
hours O
he O
was O
attacked O
by O
a O
fever O
, O

died O
three O
days O
afterwards O

We O
performed O
the O

up O

a O
thirty-six O

young O

melancholy O

Then O
, O
as O
they O
were O
just O
passing O
the O
Round O
Tower O
, O
the O
young O
man O
shouted O
: O

At O
this O
last O

all O
the O
sails O

lowered O

the O

moved O
almost O
imperceptibly O
onwards O

The O
owner O
did O
not O
wait O
for O
a O

invitation O

He O
seized O
a O
rope O

DantÃ¨s I-PERSON
flung O
to O
him O
, O
and O
with O
an O
activity O
that O
would O
have O
done O
credit O

up O

going O

twenty-five O

twenty-six O

in O
