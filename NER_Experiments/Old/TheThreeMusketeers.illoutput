the O
irascibility O
of O
the O
young O
man O
, O
the O
effect O
produced O
upon O
him O
by O
this O
vociferous O
mirth O
may O
be O
easily O
imagined O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
dâ€™Artagnan O
was O
desirous O
of O
examining O
the O
appearance O
of O
this O
impertinent O
personage O
who O
ridiculed O
him O
. O
He O
fixed O
his O
haughty O
eye O
upon O
the O
stranger O
, O
and O
perceived O
a O
man O
of O
from O
forty O
to O
forty-five O
years O
of O
age O
, O
with O
black O
and O
piercing O
eyes O
, O
pale O
complexion O
, O
a O
strongly O
marked O
nose O
, O
and O
a O
black O
and O
well-shaped O
mustache O
. O
He O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
doublet O
and O
hose O
of O
a O
violet O
color O
, O
with O
aiguillettes O
of O
the O
same O
color O
, O
without O
any O
other O
ornaments O
than O
the O
customary O
slashes O
, O
through O
which O
the O
shirt O
appeared O
. O
This O
doublet O
and O
hose O
, O
though O
new O
, O
were O
creased O
, O
like O
traveling O
clothes O
for O
a O
long O
time O
packed O
in O
a O
portmanteau O
. O
Dâ€™Artagnan PER
made O
all O
these O
remarks O
with O
the O
rapidity O
of O
a O
most O
minute O
observer O
, O
and O
doubtless O
from O
an O
instinctive O
feeling O
that O
this O
stranger O
was O
destined O
to O
have O
a O
great O
influence O
over O
his O
future O
life O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
at O
the O
moment O
in O
which O
dâ€™Artagnan O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
gentleman O
in O
the O
violet O
doublet O
, O
the O
gentleman O
made O
one O
of O
his O
most O
knowing O
and O
profound O
remarks O
respecting O
the O
Bearnese MISC
pony O
, O
his O
two O
auditors O
laughed O
even O
louder O
than O
before O
, O
and O
he O
himself O
, O
though O
contrary O
to O
his O
custom O
, O
allowed O
a O
pale O
smile O
( O
if O
I O
may O
be O
allowed O
to O
use O
such O
an O
expression O
) O
to O
stray O
over O
his O
countenance O
. O
This O
time O
there O
could O
be O
no O
doubt O
; O
dâ€™Artagnan O
was O
really O
insulted O
. O
Full O
, O
then O
, O
of O
this O
conviction O
, O
he O
pulled O
his O
cap O
down O
over O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
endeavoring O
to O
copy O
some O
of O
the O
court O
airs O
he O
had O
picked O
up O
in O
Gascony LOC
among O
young O
traveling O
nobles O
, O
he O
advanced O
with O
one O
hand O
on O
the O
hilt O
of O
his O
sword O
and O
the O
other O
resting O
on O
his O
hip O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
as O
he O
advanced O
, O
his O
anger O
increased O
at O
every O
step O
; O
and O
instead O
of O
the O
proper O
and O
lofty O
speech O
he O
had O
prepared O
as O
a O
prelude O
to O
his O
challenge O
, O
he O
found O
nothing O
at O
the O
tip O
of O
his O
tongue O
but O
a O
gross O
personality O
, O
which O
he O
accompanied O
with O
a O
furious O
gesture O
. O
" O
I O
say O
, O
sir O
, O
you O
sir O

who O
are O

yourself O
behind O

me O

you O

we O
will O
laugh O
together O

" O
The O
gentleman O
raised O
his O
eyes O
slowly O
from O
the O
nag O
to O
his O
cavalier O
, O
as O
if O
he O
required O
some O
time O
to O
ascertain O
whether O
it O
could O
be O
to O
him O
that O
such O
strange O
reproaches O
were O
addressed O
; O
then O
, O
when O
he O
could O
not O
possibly O
entertain O
any O
doubt O
of O
the O
matter O
, O
his O
eyebrows O
slightly O
bent O
, O
and O
with O
an O
accent O
of O
irony O
and O
insolence O
impossible O
to O
be O
described O
, O
he O
replied O
to O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
" O
I O
was O
not O
speaking O
to O
you O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
am O
speaking O
to O
you O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
young O
man O
, O
additionally O
exasperated O
with O
this O
mixture O
of O
insolence O
and O
good O
manners O
, O
of O
politeness O
and O
scorn O
. O
The O
stranger O
looked O
at O
him O
again O
with O
a O
slight O
smile O
, O
and O
retiring O
from O
the O
window O
, O
came O
out O
of O
the O
hostelry O
with O
a O
slow O
step O
, O
and O
placed O
himself O
before O
the O
horse O
, O
within O
two O
paces O
of O
dâ€™Artagnan O
. O
His O
quiet O
manner O
and O
the O
ironical O
expression O
of O
his O
countenance O
redoubled O
the O
mirth O
of O
the O
persons O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
talking O
, O
and O
who O
still O
remained O
at O
the O
window O
. O
Dâ€™Artagnan PER
, O
seeing O
him O
approach O
, O
drew O
his O
sword O
a O
foot O
out O
of O
the O
scabbard O
. O
" O
This O
horse O
is O
decidedly O
, O
or O
rather O
has O
been O
in O
his O
youth O
, O
a O
buttercup O

" O
resumed O
the O
stranger O
, O
continuing O
the O
remarks O
he O
had O
begun O
, O
and O
addressing O
himself O
to O
his O
auditors O
at O
the O
window O
, O
without O
paying O
the O
least O
attention O
to O
the O
exasperation O
of O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
placed O
himself O
between O
him O
and O
them O
. O
" O
It O
is O
a O
color O
very O
well O
known O
in O

the O

rare O
among O

" O
" O
There O

at O
the O
horse O
that O
would O
not O
dare O
to O

" O
cried O
the O
young O
emulator O
of O
the O
furious O
Treville PER
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
often O
laugh O
, O
sir O

" O
replied O
the O
stranger O
, O
" O
as O
you O
may O
perceive O
by O
the O
expression O
of O
my O
countenance O
; O
but O
nevertheless O
I O
retain O
the O
privilege O
of O
laughing O
when O
I O
please O

" O
" O
And O
I O
, O
" O
cried O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
" O
will O
allow O
no O
man O
to O
laugh O
when O
it O
displeases O
me O
! O
" O
" O
Indeed O

sir O

" O
continued O
the O
stranger O
, O
more O
calm O
than O
ever O
; O
" O
well O
, O
that O
is O
perfectly O
right O
! O
" O
and O
turning O
on O
his O
heel O
, O
was O
about O
to O
re-enter O
the O
hostelry O
by O
the O
front O
gate O
, O
beneath O
which O
dâ€™Artagnan O
on O
arriving O
had O
observed O
a O
saddled O
horse O
. O
But O
, O
dâ€™Artagnan O
was O
not O
of O
a O
character O
to O
allow O
a O
man O
to O
escape O
him O
thus O
who O
had O
the O
insolence O
to O
ridicule O
him O
. O
He O
drew O
his O
sword O
entirely O
from O
the O
scabbard O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
, O
crying O
, O
" O
Turn O

lest O
I O
strike O
you O

" O
" O

" O
said O
the O
other O
, O
turning O
on O
his O
heels O
, O
and O
surveying O
the O
young O
man O
with O
as O
much O
astonishment O
as O
contempt O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
my O
good O
fellow O
, O
you O
must O
be O
mad O
! O
" O
Then O
, O
in O
a O
suppressed O
tone O
, O
as O
if O
speaking O
to O
himself O
, O
" O
This O
is O
annoying O
, O
" O
continued O
he O

" O
What O
a O
godsend O
this O
would O
be O
for O

seeking O
everywhere O

fellows O

recruit O
for O
his O
Musketeers ORG
! O
" O
He O
had O
scarcely O
finished O
, O
when O
dâ€™Artagnan O
made O
such O
a O
furious O
lunge O
at O
him O
that O
if O
he O
had O
not O
sprung O
nimbly O
backward O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
he O
would O
have O
jested O
for O
the O
last O
time O
. O
The O
stranger O
, O
then O
perceiving O
that O
the O
matter O
went O
beyond O
raillery O
, O
drew O
his O
sword O
, O
saluted O
his O
adversary O
, O
and O
seriously O
placed O
himself O
on O
guard O
. O
But O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
, O
his O
two O
auditors O
, O
accompanied O
by O
the O
host O
, O
fell O
upon O
dâ€™Artagnan O
with O
sticks O
, O
shovels O
and O
tongs O
. O
This O
caused O
so O
rapid O
and O
complete O
a O
diversion O
from O
the O
attack O
that O
dâ€™Artagnan O
's O
adversary O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
turned O
round O
to O
face O
this O
shower O
of O
blows O
, O
sheathed O
his O
sword O
with O
the O
same O
precision O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
an O
actor O
, O
which O
he O
had O
nearly O
been O
, O
became O
a O
spectator O
of O
the O
fight O
-- O
a O
part O
in O
which O
he O
acquitted O
himself O
with O
his O
usual O
impassiveness O
, O
muttering O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
" O

" O
" O

" O
cried O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
making O
the O
best O
face O
possible O
, O
and O
never O
retreating O
one O
step O
before O
his O
three O
assailants O
, O
who O
continued O
to O
shower O
blows O
upon O
him O
. O
" O
Another O
gasconade O

the O
gentleman O

" O
By O

Keep O
up O
the O

then O
, O
since O

When O

he O

" O
But O
the O
stranger O
knew O
not O
the O
headstrong O
personage O
he O
had O
to O
do O
with O
; O
dâ€™Artagnan O
was O
not O
the O
man O
ever O
to O
cry O
for O
quarter O
. O
The O
fight O
was O
therefore O
prolonged O
for O
some O
seconds O
; O
but O
at O
length O
dâ€™Artagnan O
dropped O
his O
sword O
, O
which O
was O
broken O
in O
two O
pieces O
by O
the O
blow O
of O
a O
stick O

Another O
blow O
full O
upon O
his O
forehead O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
brought O
him O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
covered O
with O
blood O
and O
almost O
fainting O

It O
was O
at O
this O
moment O
that O
people O
came O
flocking O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
action O
from O
all O
sides O

The O
host O
, O
fearful O
of O
consequences O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
his O
servants O
carried O
the O
wounded O
man O
into O
the O
kitchen O

where O
some O
trifling O
attentions O
were O
bestowed O
upon O
him O

As O
to O
the O
gentleman O
, O
he O
resumed O
his O
place O
at O
the O
window O
, O
and O
surveyed O
the O
crowd O
with O
a O
certain O
impatience O
, O
evidently O
annoyed O
by O
their O
remaining O
undispersed O

" O
Well O

exclaimed O

turning O
round O

the O
noise O

the O
door O

the O
entrance O

the O

The O

had O
reckoned O
upon O
eleven O
days O

confinement O
at O
a O
crown O
a O
day O

had O
reckoned O
without O

On O
the O
following O
morning O
at O
five O
oâ€™clock O
dâ€™Artagnan O
arose O
, O
and O
descending O
to O
the O
kitchen O
without O
help O

asked O
, O
among O
other O
ingredients O
the O
list O
of O
which O
has O
not O
come O
down O
to O
us O

for O
some O
oil O

some O
wine O

some O
rosemary O
, O
and O
with O
his O
mother O

recipe O
in O
his O
hand O
composed O
a O
balsam O
, O
with O
which O
he O
anointed O
his O
numerous O
wounds O
, O
replacing O
his O
bandages O
himself O
, O
and O
positively O
refusing O
the O
assistance O
of O
any O
doctor O
, O
dâ€™Artagnan O
walked O
about O
that O

evening O

was O
almost O
cured O
by O
the O
morrow O

But O
when O
the O
time O
came O
to O
pay O
for O
his O
rosemary O

this O
oil O

the O
wine O

the O
only O
expense O
the O
master O

incurred O

as O

had O
preserved O
a O
strict O
abstinence O

while O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
yellow O
horse O
, O
by O
the O
account O
of O
the O
hostler O
at O
least O
, O
had O
eaten O
three O
times O
as O
much O
as O
a O
horse O
of O
his O
size O
could O
reasonably O
be O
supposed O
to O
have O
done O
-- O
dâ€™Artagnan O
found O
nothing O
in O
his O
pocket O

his O
little O
old O
velvet O
purse O
with O
the O
eleven O
crowns O
it O
contained O

for O
as O
to O
the O
letter O
addressed O
to O

it O
had O
disappeared O

The O
young O
man O
commenced O
his O
search O
for O
the O
letter O
with O
the O
greatest O
patience O
, O
turning O
out O
his O
pockets O
of O
all O
kinds O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
rummaging O
and O
rerummaging O
in O
his O
valise O

and O
opening O
and O
reopening O
his O
purse O
; O
but O
when O
he O
found O
that O
he O
had O
come O
to O
the O
conviction O
that O
the O
letter O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
, O
he O
flew O
, O
for O
the O
third O
time O
, O
into O
such O
a O
rage O
as O
was O
near O
costing O
him O
a O
fresh O
consumption O
of O
wine O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
rosemary O
-- O
for O
upon O
seeing O
this O
hot-headed O
youth O
become O
exasperated O
and O
threaten O
to O
destroy O
everything O
in O
the O
establishment O
if O
his O
letter O
were O
not O
found O
, O
the O
host O
seized O
a O
spit O

his O
wife O
a O
broom O
handle O

and O
the O
servants O
the O
same O
sticks O
they O
had O
used O
the O
day O
before O

" O

" O
Unfortunately O
, O
there O
was O
one O
circumstance O
which O
created O
a O
powerful O
obstacle O
to O
the O
accomplishment O
of O
this O
threat O
; O
which O
was O
, O
as O
we O
have O
related O
, O
that O
his O
sword O
had O
been O
in O
his O
first O
conflict O
broken O
in O
two O
, O
and O
which O
he O
had O
entirely O
forgotten O
. O
Hence O
, O
it O
resulted O
when O
dâ€™Artagnan O
proceeded O
to O
draw O
his O
sword O
in O
earnest O
, O
he O
found O
himself O
purely O
and O
simply O
armed O
with O
a O
stump O
of O
a O
sword O
about O
eight O
or O
ten O
inches O
in O
length O
, O
which O
the O
host O
had O
carefully O
placed O
in O
the O
scabbard O
. O
As O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
blade O
, O
the O
master O
had O
slyly O
put O
that O
on O
one O
side O
to O
make O
himself O
a O
larding O
pin O
. O
But O
this O
deception O
would O
probably O
not O
have O
stopped O
our O
fiery O
young O
man O
if O
the O
host O
had O
not O
reflected O
that O
the O
reclamation O
which O
his O
guest O
made O
was O
perfectly O
just O
. O
" O
But O
, O
after O
all O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
lowering O
the O
point O
of O
his O
spit O
, O
" O

" O
" O

" O
answered O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
who O
, O
reckoning O
upon O
entering O
into O
the O
king O
's O
service O
in O
consequence O
of O
this O
recommendation O
, O
believed O
he O
could O
make O
this O
somewhat O
hazardous O
reply O
without O
telling O
of O
a O
falsehood O
. O
" O
The O
devil O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
host O
, O
at O
his O
wit O
's O
end O
. O
" O
But O
it O
's O
of O
no O
importance O
, O
" O
continued O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
with O
natural O
assurance O
; O
" O
it O
's O
of O
no O
importance O
. O
The O
money O
is O
nothing O
; O
that O
letter O
was O
everything O
. O
I O
would O
rather O
have O
lost O
a O
thousand O
pistoles O
than O
have O
lost O
it O
. O
" O
He O
would O
not O
have O
risked O
more O
if O
he O
had O
said O
twenty O
thousand O
; O
but O
a O
certain O
juvenile O
modesty O
restrained O
him O
. O
A O
ray O
of O
light O
all O
at O
once O
broke O
upon O
the O
mind O
of O
the O
host O
as O
he O
was O
giving O
himself O
to O
the O
devil O
upon O
finding O
nothing O
. O
" O
That O
letter O
is O
not O
lost O
! O
" O
cried O
he O
. O
" O
What O
! O
" O
cried O
dâ€™Artagnan O
. O
" O
No O
, O
it O
has O
been O
stolen O
from O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Stolen O
? O
By O
whom O
? O
" O
" O
By O
the O
gentleman O
who O
was O
here O
yesterday O
. O
He O
came O
down O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
where O
your O
doublet O
was O
. O
He O
remained O
there O
some O
time O
alone O
. O
I O
would O
lay O
a O
wager O
he O
has O
stolen O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
so O
? O
" O
answered O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
but O
little O
convinced O
, O
as O
he O
knew O
better O
than O
anyone O
else O
how O
entirely O
personal O
the O
value O
of O
this O
letter O
was O
, O
and O
saw O
nothing O
in O
it O
likely O
to O
tempt O
cupidity O
. O
The O
fact O
was O
that O
none O
of O
his O
servants O
, O
none O
of O
the O
travelers O
present O
, O
could O
have O
gained O
anything O
by O
being O
possessed O
of O
this O
paper O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
say O
, O
" O
resumed O
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
" O
that O
you O
suspect O
that O
impertinent O
gentleman O
? O
" O
" O
I O
tell O
you O
I O
am O
sure O
of O
it O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
host O
. O
" O
When O
I O
informed O
him O
that O
your O
lordship O
was O
the O
protege O
of O
Monsieur LOC
de LOC
Treville LOC
, O
and O
that O
you O
even O
had O
a O
letter O
for O
that O
illustrious O
gentleman O
, O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
very O
much O
disturbed O
, O
and O
asked O
me O
where O
that O
letter O
was O
, O
and O
immediately O
came O
down O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
where O
he O
knew O
your O
doublet O
was O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
that O
's O
my O
thief O
, O
" O
replied O
dâ€™Artagnan O
. O
" O
I O
will O
complain O
to O
Monsieur LOC
de LOC
Treville LOC
, O
and O
Monsieur LOC
de LOC
Treville LOC
will O
complain O
to O
the O
king O
. O
" O
He O
then O
drew O
two O
crowns O
majestically O
from O
his O
purse O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
host O
, O
who O
accompanied O
him O
, O
cap O
in O
hand O
, O
to O
the O
gate O
, O
and O
remounted O
his O
yellow O
horse O
, O
which O
bore O
him O
without O
any O
further O
accident O
to O
the O
gate O
of O
St. LOC
Antoine LOC
at O
Paris LOC
, O
where O
his O
owner O
sold O
him O
for O
three O
crowns O
, O
which O
was O
a O
very O
good O
price O
, O
considering O
that O
dâ€™Artagnan O
had O
ridden O
him O
hard O
during O
the O
last O
stage O
. O
Thus O
the O
dealer O
to O
whom O
dâ€™Artagnan O
sold O
him O
for O
the O
nine O
livres O
did O
not O
conceal O
from O
the O
young O
man O
that O
he O
only O
gave O
that O
enormous O
sum O
for O
him O
on O
the O
account O
of O
the O
originality O
of O
his O
color O
. O
Thus O
dâ€™Artagnan O
entered O
Paris LOC
on O
foot O
, O
carrying O
his O
little O
packet O
under O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
walked O
about O
till O
he O
found O
an O
apartment O
to O
be O
let O
on O
terms O
suited O
to O
the O
scantiness O
of O
his O
means O
. O
This O
chamber O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
garret O
, O
situated O
in O
the O
Rue LOC

Fossoyeurs LOC

near O
the O
Luxembourg LOC

As O
soon O
as O
the O
earnest O
money O
was O
paid O
, O
dâ€™Artagnan O
took O
possession O
of O
his O
lodging O
, O
and O
passed O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
day O
in O
sewing O
onto O
his O
doublet O
and O
hose O
some O
ornamental O
braiding O
which O
his O
mother O
had O
taken O
off O
an O
almost-new O
doublet O
of O
the O
elder O
M. PER
dâ€™Artagnan O
, O
and O
which O
she O
had O
given O
her O
son O
secretly O

Next O
he O
went O
to O
the O
Quai LOC

Feraille LOC
to O
have O
a O
new O
blade O
put O
to O
his O
sword O

and O
then O
returned O

inquiring O

met O
for O
the O

which O
proved O

that O

in O
the O

a O

After O
this O
