0.191668633505568	6	|I feared to go very far from the station , as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible . |	|The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East ; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube , which is here of noble width and depth , took us among the traditions of Turkish rule . |	|We left in pretty good time , and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh . |	1	DEFAULT

0.53928964753798	213	|He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose -- it must have been very faint , for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all -- and gathering a few stones , formed them into some device . |	|Once there appeared a strange optical effect : when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it , for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same . |	|This startled me , but as the effect was only momentary , I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.388492924568841	101	|The wine was Golden Mediasch , which produces a queer sting on the tongue , which is , however , not disagreeable . |	|I had only a couple of glasses of this , and nothing else . |	|When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat , and I saw him talking with the landlady . |	1	DEFAULT

0.783568956972008	109	|With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant ; he would not answer at first , but on learning that I was English , he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye . |	|This was not very pleasant for me , just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man ; but every one seemed so kind-hearted , and so sorrowful , and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched . |	|I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures , all crossing themselves , as they stood round the wide archway , with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.096114319832848	118	|I could not understand then what the haste meant , but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund . |	|I was told that this road is in summertime excellent , but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows . |	|In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians , for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.451037770945131	122	|Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves . |	|Right and left of us they towered , with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range , deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks , green and brown where grass and rock mingled , and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags , till these were themselves lost in the distance , where the snowy peaks rose grandly . |	|Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains , through which , as the sun began to sink , we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water . |	0

0.637919786384644	36	|It takes a lot of water , and running strong , to sweep the outside edge of a river clear . |	|At every station there were groups of people , sometimes crowds , and in all sorts of attire . |	|Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany , with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers ; but others were very picturesque . |	0										
0.223109901013215	203	|It grew colder and colder still , and fine , powdery snow began to fall , so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket . |	|The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs , though this grew fainter as we went on our way . |	|The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer , as though they were closing round on us from every side . |	0										
0.529517171670374	158	|The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps , in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud . |	|We could see now the sandy road lying white before us , but there was on it no sign of a vehicle . |	|The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness , which seemed to mock my own disappointment . |	0										
0.995488787862192	152	|It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected , but though I asked each passenger , no one would give me the slightest explanation . |	|This state of excitement kept on for some little time ; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side . |	|There were dark , rolling clouds overhead , and in the air the heavy , oppressive sense of thunder . |	0

0.912855708312398	14	|I found my smattering of German very useful here ; indeed , I do n't know how I should be able to get on without it . |	|Having had some time at my disposal when in London , I had visited the British Museum , and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania ; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country . |	|I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country , just on the borders of three states , Transylvania , Moldavia and Bukovina , in the midst of the Carpathian mountains ; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe . |	1	DEFAULT

0.649048271706906	176	|The passenger turned his face away , at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself . |	|` Give me the Herr 's luggage , ' said the driver ; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calÃ¨che . |	|Then I descended from the side of the coach , as the calÃ¨che was close alongside , the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel ; his strength must have been prodigious . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.275912981612609	231	|The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way , now in almost complete darkness , for the rolling clouds obscured the moon . |	|We kept on ascending , with occasional periods of quick descent , but in the main always ascending . |	|Suddenly , I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle , from whose tall black windows came no ray of light , and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky . |	0										
0.038423004234804	121	|Of old the Hospadars would not repair them , lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops , and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point . |	|Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves . |	|Right and left of us they towered , with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range , deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks , green and brown where grass and rock mingled , and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags , till these were themselves lost in the distance , where the snowy peaks rose grandly . |	0										
0.048173060404167	44	|On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands . |	|They are , however , I am told , very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion . |	|It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz , which is a very interesting old place . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.007560348766164	131	|Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks , all in picturesque attire , but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent . |	|By the roadside were many crosses , and as we swept by , my companions all crossed themselves . |	|Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine , who did not even turn round as we approached , but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.539122198323943	90	|She saw , I suppose , the doubt in my face , for she put the rosary round my neck , and said , ` For your mother 's sake , ' and went out of the room . |	|I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach , which is , of course , late ; and the crucifix is still round my neck . |	|Whether it is the old lady 's fear , or the many ghostly traditions of this place , or the crucifix itself , I do not know , but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.694284796115718	198	|He petted and soothed them , and whispered something in their ears , as I have heard of horse-tamers doing , and with extraordinary effect , for under his caresses they became quite manageable again , though they still trembled . |	|The driver again took his seat , and shaking his reins , started off at a great pace . |	|This time , after going to the far side of the Pass , he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.935602115613638	18	|I shall enter here some of my notes , as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina . |	|In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities : Saxons in the South , and mixed with them the Wallachs , who are the descendants of the Dacians ; Magyars in the West , and Szekelys in the East and North . |	|I am going among the latter , who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns . |	0										
0.30700924567251	116	|In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the ` Mittel Land ' ran the road , losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve , or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods , which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame . |	|The road was rugged , but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste . |	|I could not understand then what the haste meant , but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund . |	0										
0.453079366760987	173	|As he spoke he smiled , and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth , with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth , as white as ivory . |	|One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger 's ` Lenore ' : -- ` Denn die Todten reiten schnell ' -- -LRB- ` For the dead travel fast .

0.183279339058434	226	|How he came there , I know not , but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command , and looking towards the sound , saw him stand in the roadway . |	|As he swept his long arms , as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle , the wolves fell back and back further still . |	|Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon , so that we were again in darkness . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.423286344572902	140	|I wished to get down and walk up them , as we do at home , but the driver would not hear of it . |	|` No , no , ' he said ; ` you must not walk here ; the dogs are too fierce ' ; and then he added , with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry -- for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest -- ` and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep .

0.729066286958659	35	|Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals ; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods . |	|It takes a lot of water , and running strong , to sweep the outside edge of a river clear . |	|At every station there were groups of people , sometimes crowds , and in all sorts of attire . |	0										
0.932033380854062	191	|This gave me a sort of shock , for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences . |	|I waited with a sick feeling of suspense . |	|Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road -- a long , agonised wailing , as if from fear . |	1	DEFAULT

0.688805460981301	97	|_ -- The grey of the morning has passed , and the sun is high over the distant horizon , which seems jagged , whether with trees or hills I know not , for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed . |	|I am not sleepy , and , as I am not to be called till I awake , naturally I write till sleep comes . |	|There are many odd things to put down , and , lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz , let me put down my dinner exactly . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.183804597197987	50	|Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel , which I found , to my great delight , to be thoroughly old-fashioned , for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country . |	|I was evidently expected , for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress -- white undergarment with long double apron , front , and back , of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty . |	|When I came close she bowed and said , ` The Herr Englishman ?

0.900300939468996	224	|I called to the coachman to come , for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach . |	|I shouted and beat the side of the calÃ¨che , hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side , so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap . |	|How he came there , I know not , but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command , and looking towards the sound , saw him stand in the roadway . |	1	DEFAULT
