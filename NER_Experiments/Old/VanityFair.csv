0.371035769223123	199	|Attempting once to scold her in public , Rebecca hit upon the before-mentioned plan of answering her in French , which quite routed the old woman . |	|In order to maintain authority in her school , it became necessary to remove this rebel , this monster , this serpent , this firebrand ; and hearing about this time that Sir Pitt Crawley 's family was in want of a governess , she actually recommended Miss Sharp for the situation , firebrand and serpent as she was . ' |	|I can not , certainly , ' she said , ` find fault with Miss Sharp 's conduct , except to myself ; and must allow that her talents and accomplishments are of a high order . |	2	Miss Rebecca Sharp	Pitt Crawley								
0.731384766127082	96	|The carriage rolled away ; the great gates were closed ; the bell rang for the dancing lesson . |	|The world is before the two young ladies ; and so , farewell to Chiswick Mall . |	|CHAPTER II In Which Miss Sharp and Miss Sedley Prepare to Open the Campaign When Miss Sharp had performed the heroical act mentioned in the last chapter , and had seen the Dixonary , flying over the pavement of the little garden , fall at length at the feet of the astonished Miss Jemima , the young lady 's countenance , which had before worn an almost livid look of hatred , assumed a smile that perhaps was scarcely more agreeable , and she sank back in the carriage in an easy frame of mind , saying -- ` So much for the Dixonary ; and , thank God , I 'm out of Chiswick .

0.871035907373534	43	|Now , Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular species ; and deserved not only all that Miss Pinkerton said in her praise , but had many charming qualities which that pompous old Minerva of a woman could not see , from the differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself . |	|For she could not only sing like a lark , or a Mrs. Billington , and dance like Hillisberg or Parisot ; and embroider beautifully ; and spell as well as a Dixonary itself ; but she had such a kindly , smiling , tender , gentle , generous heart of her own , as won the love of everybody who came near her , from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery , and the one-eyed tart-woman 's daughter , who was permitted to vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the Mall . |	|She had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies . |	3	Miss Amelia Sedley	Minerva	Mrs. Billington							
0.766842949819883	153	|She was small and slight in person ; pale , sandy-haired , and with eyes habitually cast down : when they looked up they were very large , odd , and attractive ; so attractive that the Reverend Mr. Crisp , fresh from Oxford , and curate to the Vicar of Chiswick , the Reverend Mr. Flowerdew , fell in love with Miss Sharp ; being shot dead by a glance of her eyes which was fired all the way across Chiswick Church from the school-pew to the reading-desk . |	|This infatuated young man used sometimes to take tea with Miss Pinkerton , to whom he had been presented by his mamma , and actually proposed something like marriage in an intercepted note , which the one-eyed apple-woman was charged to deliver . |	|Mrs. Crisp was summoned from Buxton , and abruptly carried off her darling boy ; but the idea , even , of such an eagle in the Chiswick dovecot caused a great flutter in the breast of Miss Pinkerton , who would have sent away Miss Sharp but that she was bound to her under a forfeit , and who never could thoroughly believe the young lady 's protestations that she had never exchanged a single word with Mr. Crisp , except under her own eyes on the two occasions when she had met him at tea . |	2	Mr. Crisp	Miss Pinkerton's								
0.931809269069515	8	|` The girls were up at four this morning , packing her trunks , sister , ' replied Miss Jemima ; ` we have made her a bow-pot .

' |	|Worthy Miss Pinkerton , although she had a Roman nose and a turban , and was as tall as a grenadier , and had been up to this time an irresistible princess , had no will or strength like that of her little apprentice , and in vain did battle against her , and tried to overawe her . |	1	Miss Pinkerton's									
0.853842060733116	147	|The humble calling of her female parent Miss Sharp never alluded to , but used to state subsequently that the Entrechats were a noble family of Gascony , and took great pride in her descent from them . |	|And curious it is that as she advanced in life this young lady 's ancestors increased in rank and splendour . |	|Rebecca 's mother had had some education somewhere , and her daughter spoke French with purity and a Parisian accent . |	1	Miss Rebecca Sharp									
0.536616543184123	193	|I will do nothing here but what I am obliged to do .

0.74975090727718	158	|Many a dun had she talked to , and turned away from her father 's door ; many a tradesman had she coaxed and wheedled into good-humour , and into the granting of one meal more . |	|She sate commonly with her father , who was very proud of her wit , and heard the talk of many of his wild companions -- often but ill-suited for a girl to hear . |	|But she never had been a girl , she said ; she had been a woman since she was eight years old . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT

0.713552413743637	111	|I hope I may never set eyes on it again . |	|I wish it were in the bottom of the Thames , I do ; and if Miss Pinkerton were there , I would n't pick her out , that I would n't . |	|O how I should like to see her floating in the water yonder , turban and all , with her train streaming after her , and her nose like the beak of a wherry .

0.658629908650648	103	|Dr. Raine and his rod were just as awful to him in his heart , then , at sixty-eight , as they had been at thirteen . |	|If the Doctor , with a large birch , had appeared bodily to him , even at the age of threescore and eight , and had said in awful voice , ` Boy , take down your pant -- ' ? |	|Well , well , Miss Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination . |	2	Dr. Raine	DEFAULT								
0.249334830851546	72	|Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile and bow , and quite declined to accept the proffered honour ; on which Semiramis tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever . |	|In fact , it was a little battle between the young lady and the old one , and the latter was worsted . |	|` Heaven bless you , my child , ' said she , embracing Amelia , and scowling the while over the girl 's shoulder at Miss Sharp . |	0										
0.396942572770629	161	|Oh , why did Miss Pinkerton let such a dangerous bird into her cage ? |	|The fact is , the old lady believed Rebecca to be the meekest creature in the world , so admirably , on the occasions when her father brought her to Chiswick , used Rebecca to perform the part of the ingenue ; and only a year before the arrangement by which Rebecca had been admitted into her house , and when Rebecca was sixteen years old , Miss Pinkerton majestically , and with a little speech , made her a present of a doll -- which was , by the way , the confiscated property of Miss Swindle , discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school-hours . |	|How the father and daughter laughed as they trudged home together after the evening party -LRB- it was on the occasion of the speeches , when all the professors were invited -RRB- and how Miss Pinkerton would have raged had she seen the caricature of herself which the little mimic , Rebecca , managed to make out of her doll . |	3	Miss Rebecca Sharp	Miss Pinkerton's	Miss Swindle							
0.142103445004558	30	|` For whom is this , Miss Jemima ? ' |	|said Miss Pinkerton , with awful coldness . |	|` For Becky Sharp , ' answered Jemima , trembling very much , and blushing over her withered face and neck , as she turned her back on her sister . |	1	Miss Pinkerton's

0.201551566428487	39	|` Send Miss Sedley instantly to me , ' said Miss Pinkerton . |	|And so venturing not to say another word , poor Jemima trotted off , exceedingly flurried and nervous . |	|Miss Sedley 's papa was a merchant in London , and a man of some wealth ; whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil , for whom Miss Pinkerton had done , as she thought , quite enough , without conferring upon her at parting the high honour of the Dixonary . |	1	Miss Jemima									
0.194903508398168	10	|` Well , a booky as big almost as a haystack ; I have put up two bottles of the gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley , and the receipt for making it , in Amelia 's box .

0.842765360672787	232	|He is very kind and good , but he scarcely ever speaks to me ; I think he loves his pipe a great deal better than his ' -- but here Amelia checked herself , for why should she speak ill of her brother ? |	|` He was very kind to me as a child , ' she added ; ' I was but five years old when he went away .

0.031824237971218	203	|And so the schoolmistress reconciled the recommendation to her conscience , and the indentures were cancelled , and the apprentice was free . |	|The battle here described in a few lines , of course , lasted for some months . |	|And as Miss Sedley , being now in her seventeenth year , was about to leave school , and had a friendship for Miss Sharp -LRB- '' tis the only point in Amelia 's behaviour , ' said Minerva , ` which has not been satisfactory to her mistress ' -RRB- , Miss Sharp was invited by her friend to pass a week with her at home , before she entered upon her duties as governess in a private family . |	0										
0.861519325185783	174	|The happiness -- the superior advantages of the young women round about her , gave Rebecca inexpressible pangs of envy . |	|` What airs that girl gives herself , because she is an Earl 's grand-daughter , ' she said of one . |	|` How they cringe and bow to that Creole , because of her hundred thousand pounds ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.586311828358844	26	|On the cover was inserted a copy of ` Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton 's school , at the Mall ; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson .

0.060990388209226	25	|This letter completed , Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name , and Miss Sedley 's , in the fly-leaf of a Johnson 's Dictionary -- the interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars , on their departure from the Mall . |	|On the cover was inserted a copy of ` Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton 's school , at the Mall ; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson .

0.725194071218122	102	|Fancy had carried him back five-and-fifty years in the course of that evening . |	|Dr. Raine and his rod were just as awful to him in his heart , then , at sixty-eight , as they had been at thirteen . |	|If the Doctor , with a large birch , had appeared bodily to him , even at the age of threescore and eight , and had said in awful voice , ` Boy , take down your pant -- ' ? |	2	Dr. Raine	DEFAULT								
0.351860911841302	2	|A black servant , who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman , uncurled his bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton 's shining brass plate , and as he pulled the bell at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house . |	|Nay , the acute observer might have recognized the little red nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself , rising over some geranium pots in the window of that lady 's own drawing-room . |	|` It is Mrs. Sedley 's coach , sister , ' said Miss Jemima . |	1	Miss Jemima

0.767125334627842	173	|The gentle tender-hearted Amelia Sedley was the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least ; and who could help attaching herself to Amelia ? |	|The happiness -- the superior advantages of the young women round about her , gave Rebecca inexpressible pangs of envy . |	|` What airs that girl gives herself , because she is an Earl 's grand-daughter , ' she said of one . |	1	Miss Rebecca Sharp									
0.48766849542913	44	|For she could not only sing like a lark , or a Mrs. Billington , and dance like Hillisberg or Parisot ; and embroider beautifully ; and spell as well as a Dixonary itself ; but she had such a kindly , smiling , tender , gentle , generous heart of her own , as won the love of everybody who came near her , from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery , and the one-eyed tart-woman 's daughter , who was permitted to vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the Mall . |	|She had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies . |	|Even envious Miss Briggs never spoke ill of her ; high and mighty Miss Saltire -LRB- Lord Dexter 's granddaughter -RRB- allowed that her figure was genteel ; and as for Miss Swartz , the rich woolly-haired mulatto from St. Kitt 's , on the day Amelia went away , she was in such a passion of tears that they were obliged to send for Dr. Floss , and half tipsify her with salvolatile . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.757075482304642	128	|Vive Bonaparte ! ' ' |	|O Rebecca , Rebecca , for shame ! ' |	|cried Miss Sedley ; for this was the greatest blasphemy Rebecca had as yet uttered ; and in those days , in England , to say , ` Long live Bonaparte ! ' |	1	Miss Rebecca Sharp

0.784917326181283	69	|I suppose I must , ' said Miss Sharp calmly , and much to the wonder of Miss Jemima ; and the latter having knocked at the door , and receiving permission to come in , Miss Sharp advanced in a very unconcerned manner , and said in French , and with a perfect accent , ` Mademoiselle , je viens vous faire mes adieux . ' |	|Miss Pinkerton did not understand French ; she only directed those who did : but biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and Roman-nosed head -LRB- on the top of which figured a large and solemn turban -RRB- , she said , ` Miss Sharp , I wish you a good morning .

0.341851035316719	46	|Even envious Miss Briggs never spoke ill of her ; high and mighty Miss Saltire -LRB- Lord Dexter 's granddaughter -RRB- allowed that her figure was genteel ; and as for Miss Swartz , the rich woolly-haired mulatto from St. Kitt 's , on the day Amelia went away , she was in such a passion of tears that they were obliged to send for Dr. Floss , and half tipsify her with salvolatile . |	|Miss Pinkerton 's attachment was , as may be supposed from the high position and eminent virtues of that lady , calm and dignified ; but Miss Jemima had already whimpered several times at the idea of Amelia 's departure ; and , but for fear of her sister , would have gone off in downright hysterics , like the heiress -LRB- who paid double -RRB- of St. Kitt 's . |	|Such luxury of grief , however , is only allowed to parlour-boarders . |	3	Miss Pinkerton's	Miss Jemima	Miss Amelia Sedley							
0.186284155996303	167	|The catastrophe came , and she was brought to the Mall as to her home . |	|The rigid formality of the place suffocated her : the prayers and the meals , the lessons and the walks , which were arranged with a conventual regularity , oppressed her almost beyond endurance ; and she looked back to the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in Soho with so much regret , that everybody , herself included , fancied she was consumed with grief for her father . |	|She had a little room in the garret , where the maids heard her walking and sobbing at night ; but it was with rage , and not with grief . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.36302526675622	212	|and before the carriage arrived in Russell Square , a great deal of conversation had taken place about the Drawing-room , and whether or not young ladies wore powder as well as hoops when presented , and whether she was to have that honour : to the Lord Mayor 's ball she knew she was to go . |	|And when at length home was reached , Miss Amelia Sedley skipped out on Sambo 's arm , as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole big city of London . |	|Both he and coachman agreed on this point , and so did her father and mother , and so did every one of the servants in the house , as they stood bobbing , and curtseying , and smiling , in the hall to welcome their young mistress . |	2	Miss Amelia Sedley	Mr. Sambo								
0.286032977818984	244	|But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet , unused to the art of deceiving , poor innocent creature ! |	|and making her own experience in her own person . |	|The meaning of the above series of queries , as translated in the heart of this ingenious young woman , was simply this : ` If Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried , why should I not marry him ? |	1	DEFAULT									
0.843163023566886	217	|Could she not spare it ? |	|and had not her brother Joseph just brought her two from India ? |	|When Rebecca saw the two magnificent Cashmere shawls which Joseph Sedley had brought home to his sister , she said , with perfect truth , ` that it must be delightful to have a brother , ' and easily got the pity of the tender-hearted Amelia for being alone in the world , an orphan without friends or kindred . |	2	Miss Amelia Sedley	Mr. Joseph Sedley

0.721064275047654	16	|Only when her pupils quitted the establishment , or when they were about to be married , and once , when poor Miss Birch died of the scarlet fever , was Miss Pinkerton known to write personally to the parents of her pupils ; and it was Jemima 's opinion that if anything could console Mrs. Birch for her daughter 's loss , it would be that pious and eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced the event . |	|In the present instance Miss Pinkerton 's ` billet ' was to the following effect : -- The Mall , Chiswick , June 15 , 18 MADAM , -- After her six years ' residence at the Mall , I have the honour and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Sedley to her parents , as a young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished and refined circle . |	|Those virtues which characterize the young English gentlewoman , those accomplishments which become her birth and station , will not be found wanting in the amiable Miss Sedley , whose INDUSTRY and OBEDIENCE have endeared her to her instructors , and whose delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her AGED and her YOUTHFUL companions . |	2	Miss Pinkerton's	Miss Amelia Sedley
