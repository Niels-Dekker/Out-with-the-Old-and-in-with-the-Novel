|I AM BORN Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life , or whether that station will be held by anybody else , these pages must show . |	DEFAULT									
|To begin my life with the beginning of my life , I record that I was born -LRB- as I have been informed and believe -RRB- on a Friday , at twelve oâ€™clock at night . |										
|It was remarked that the clock began to strike , and I began to cry , simultaneously . |	DEFAULT									
|In consideration of the day and hour of my birth , it was declared by the nurse , and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted , first , that I was destined to be unlucky in life ; and secondly , that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits ; both these gifts inevitably attaching , as they believed , to all unlucky infants of either gender , born towards the small hours on a Friday night . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I need say nothing here , on the first head , because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result . |	DEFAULT									
|On the second branch of the question , I will only remark , that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby , I have not come into it yet . |	DEFAULT									
|But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property ; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it , he is heartily welcome to keep it . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I was born with a caul , which was advertised for sale , in the newspapers , at the low price of fifteen guineas . |	DEFAULT									
|Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time , or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets , I do n't know ; all I know is , that there was but one solitary bidding , and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business , who offered two pounds in cash , and the balance in sherry , but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain . |	DEFAULT									
|Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss -- for as to sherry , my poor dear mother 's own sherry was in the market then -- and ten years afterwards , the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country , to fifty members at half-a-crown a head , the winner to spend five shillings . |	DEFAULT									
|I was present myself , and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused , at a part of myself being disposed of in that way . |	DEFAULT									
|The caul was won , I recollect , by an old lady with a hand-basket , who , very reluctantly , produced from it the stipulated five shillings , all in halfpence , and twopence halfpenny short -- as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic , to endeavour without any effect to prove to her . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there , that she was never drowned , but died triumphantly in bed , at ninety-two . |	DEFAULT									
|I have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea -LRB- to which she was extremely partial -RRB- she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ` meandering ' about the world . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences , tea perhaps included , resulted from this objectionable practice . |	DEFAULT									
|She always returned , with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection , ` Let us have no meandering . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Not to meander myself , at present , I will go back to my birth . |	DEFAULT									
|I was born at Blunderstone , in Suffolk , or ` there by ' , as they say in Scotland . |	DEFAULT									
|I was a posthumous child . |	DEFAULT									
|My father 's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened on it . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|There is something strange to me , even now , in the reflection that he never saw me ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard , and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night , when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle , and the doors of our house were -- almost cruelly , it seemed to me sometimes -- bolted and locked against it . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|An aunt of my father 's , and consequently a great-aunt of mine , of whom I shall have more to relate by and by , was the principal magnate of our family . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|Miss Trotwood , or Miss Betsey , as my poor mother always called her , when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all -LRB- which was seldom -RRB- , had been married to a husband younger than herself , who was very handsome , except in the sense of the homely adage , ` handsome is , that handsome does ' -- for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey , and even of having once , on a disputed question of supplies , made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs ' window . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT						
|These evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off , and effect a separation by mutual consent . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|He went to India with his capital , and there , according to a wild legend in our family , he was once seen riding on an elephant , in company with a Baboon ; but I think it must have been a Baboo -- or a Begum . |	DEFAULT									
|Anyhow , from India tidings of his death reached home , within ten years . |										
|How they affected my aunt , nobody knew ; for immediately upon the separation , she took her maiden name again , bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off , established herself there as a single woman with one servant , and was understood to live secluded , ever afterwards , in an inflexible retirement . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|My father had once been a favourite of hers , I believe ; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage , on the ground that my mother was ` a wax doll ' . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|She had never seen my mother , but she knew her to be not yet twenty . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|My father and Miss Betsey never met again . |	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|He was double my mother 's age when he married , and of but a delicate constitution . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He died a year afterwards , and , as I have said , six months before I came into the world . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday . |	DEFAULT									
|I can make no claim therefore to have known , at that time , how matters stood ; or to have any remembrance , founded on the evidence of my own senses , of what follows . |	DEFAULT									
|My mother was sitting by the fire , but poorly in health , and very low in spirits , looking at it through her tears , and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger , who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins , in a drawer upstairs , to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival ; my mother , I say , was sitting by the fire , that bright , windy March afternoon , very timid and sad , and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her , when , lifting her eyes as she dried them , to the window opposite , she saw a strange lady coming up the garden . |	DEFAULT									
|My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance , that it was Miss Betsey . |	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady , over the garden-fence , and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|When she reached the house , she gave another proof of her identity . |	DEFAULT									
|My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian ; and now , instead of ringing the bell , she came and looked in at that identical window , pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent , that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield							
|She gave my mother such a turn , that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|My mother had left her chair in her agitation , and gone behind it in the corner . |	DEFAULT									
|Miss Betsey , looking round the room , slowly and inquiringly , began on the other side , and carried her eyes on , like a Saracen 's Head in a Dutch clock , until they reached my mother . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother , like one who was accustomed to be obeyed , to come and open the door . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|My mother went . |	DEFAULT									
|` Mrs. David Copperfield , I think , ' said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis referring , perhaps , to my mother 's mourning weeds , and her condition . |	David Copperfield	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|` Yes , ' said my mother , faintly . |	DEFAULT									
|` Miss Trotwood , ' said the visitor . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` You have heard of her , I dare say ? ' |	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT							
|My mother answered she had had that pleasure . |	DEFAULT									
|And she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure . |	DEFAULT									
|` Now you see her , ' said Miss Betsey . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield							
|My mother bent her head , and begged her to walk in . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|They went into the parlour my mother had come from , the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted -- not having been lighted , indeed , since my father 's funeral ; and when they were both seated , and Miss Betsey said nothing , my mother , after vainly trying to restrain herself , began to cry . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT						
|` Oh tut , tut , tut ! ' |										
|said Miss Betsey , in a hurry . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Do n't do that ! |										
|Come , come ! ' |										
|My mother could n't help it notwithstanding , so she cried until she had had her cry out . |	DEFAULT									
|` Take off your cap , child , ' said Miss Betsey , ` and let me see you . ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so . |	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|Therefore she did as she was told , and did it with such nervous hands that her hair -LRB- which was luxuriant and beautiful -RRB- fell all about her face . |	DEFAULT									
|` Why , bless my heart ! ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|exclaimed Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` You are a very Baby ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|My mother was , no doubt , unusually youthful in appearance even for her years ; she hung her head , as if it were her fault , poor thing , and said , sobbing , that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow , and would be but a childish mother if she lived . |	DEFAULT									
|In a short pause which ensued , she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair , and that with no ungentle hand ; but , looking at her , in her timid hope , she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up , her hands folded on one knee , and her feet upon the fender , frowning at the fire . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` In the name of Heaven , ' said Miss Betsey , suddenly , ` why Rookery ? ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Do you mean the house , maâ€™am ? ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|asked my mother . |	DEFAULT									
|` Why Rookery ? ' |										
|said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Cookery would have been more to the purpose , if you had had any practical ideas of life , either of you . ' |	DEFAULT									
|` The name was Mr. Copperfield 's choice , ' returned my mother . |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` When he bought the house , he liked to think that there were rooks about it . ' |	Mr. Copperfield									
|The evening wind made such a disturbance just now , among some tall old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden , that neither my mother nor Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way . |	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|As the elms bent to one another , like giants who were whispering secrets , and after a few seconds of such repose , fell into a violent flurry , tossing their wild arms about , as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind , some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks ' - nests , burdening their higher branches , swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea . |										
|` Where are the birds ? ' |										
|asked Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` The -- ? ' |										
|My mother had been thinking of something else . |	DEFAULT									
|` The rooks -- what has become of them ? ' |										
|asked Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` There have not been any since we have lived here , ' said my mother . |	DEFAULT									
|` We thought -- Mr. Copperfield thought -- it was quite a large rookery ; but the nests were very old ones , and the birds have deserted them a long while . ' |	Mr. Copperfield									
|` David Copperfield all over ! ' |	David Copperfield									
|cried Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` David Copperfield from head to foot ! |	David Copperfield									
|Calls a house a rookery when there 's not a rook near it , and takes the birds on trust , because he sees the nests ! ' |	David Copperfield									
|` Mr. Copperfield , ' returned my mother , ` is dead , and if you dare to speak unkindly of him to me -- ' My poor dear mother , I suppose , had some momentary intention of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt , who could easily have settled her with one hand , even if my mother had been in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening . |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield							
|But it passed with the action of rising from her chair ; and she sat down again very meekly , and fainted . |	DEFAULT									
|When she came to herself , or when Miss Betsey had restored her , whichever it was , she found the latter standing at the window . |	DEFAULT	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|The twilight was by this time shading down into darkness ; and dimly as they saw each other , they could not have done that without the aid of the fire . |										
|` Well ? ' |										
|said Miss Betsey , coming back to her chair , as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect ; ` and when do you expect -- ' ` I am all in a tremble , ' faltered my mother . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` I do n't know what 's the matter . |	DEFAULT									
|I shall die , I am sure ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|` No , no , no , ' said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Have some tea . ' |										
|` Oh dear me , dear me , do you think it will do me any good ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|cried my mother in a helpless manner . |	DEFAULT									
|` Of course it will , ' said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` It 's nothing but fancy . |										
|What do you call your girl ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` I do n't know that it will be a girl , yet , maâ€™am , ' said my mother innocently . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Bless the Baby ! ' |										
|exclaimed Miss Betsey , unconsciously quoting the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs , but applying it to my mother instead of me , ` I do n't mean that . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|I mean your servant-girl . ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	Ham Pegotty								
|` Peggotty , ' said my mother . |	Ham Pegotty	DEFAULT								
|` Peggotty ! ' |	Ham Pegotty									
|repeated Miss Betsey , with some indignation . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Do you mean to say , child , that any human being has gone into a Christian church , and got herself named Peggotty ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` It 's her surname , ' said my mother , faintly . |	DEFAULT	Ham Pegotty								
|` Mr. Copperfield called her by it , because her Christian name was the same as mine . ' |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` Here ! |										
|Peggotty ! ' |	Ham Pegotty									
|cried Miss Betsey , opening the parlour door . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Tea . |										
|Your mistress is a little unwell . |	DEFAULT									
|Do n't dawdle . ' |										
|Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house , and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice , Miss Betsey shut the door again , and sat down as before : with her feet on the fender , the skirt of her dress tucked up , and her hands folded on one knee . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	Ham Pegotty								
|` You were speaking about its being a girl , ' said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` I have no doubt it will be a girl . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|I have a presentiment that it must be a girl . |	DEFAULT									
|Now child , from the moment of the birth of this girl -- ' ` Perhaps boy , ' my mother took the liberty of putting in . |	DEFAULT									
|` I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ' returned Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` Do n't contradict . |										
|From the moment of this girl 's birth , child , I intend to be her friend . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I intend to be her godmother , and I beg you 'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|There must be no mistakes in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|There must be no trifling with HER affections , poor dear . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved . |	DEFAULT									
|I must make that MY care . ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|There was a twitch of Miss Betsey 's head , after each of these sentences , as if her own old wrongs were working within her , and she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|So my mother suspected , at least , as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire : too much scared by Miss Betsey , too uneasy in herself , and too subdued and bewildered altogether , to observe anything very clearly , or to know what to say . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` And was David good to you , child ? ' |	David Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|asked Miss Betsey , when she had been silent for a little while , and these motions of her head had gradually ceased . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Were you comfortable together ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` We were very happy , ' said my mother . |	DEFAULT									
|` Mr. Copperfield was only too good to me . ' |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` What , he spoilt you , I suppose ? ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT							
|returned Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again , yes , I fear he did indeed , ' sobbed my mother . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Well ! |										
|Do n't cry ! ' |										
|said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` You were not equally matched , child -- if any two people can be equally matched -- and so I asked the question . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|You were an orphan , were n't you ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` Yes . ' |										
|` And a governess ? ' |										
|` I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Copperfield								
|Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me , and took a great deal of notice of me , and paid me a good deal of attention , and at last proposed to me . |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|And I accepted him . |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|And so we were married , ' said my mother simply . |	DEFAULT									
|` Ha ! |										
|Poor Baby ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|mused Miss Betsey , with her frown still bent upon the fire . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Do you know anything ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` I beg your pardon , maâ€™am , ' faltered my mother . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` About keeping house , for instance , ' said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Not much , I fear , ' returned my mother . |	DEFAULT									
|` Not so much as I could wish . |	DEFAULT									
|But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me -- ' -LSB- ` Much he knew about it himself ! ' -RRB- |	Mr. Copperfield	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|-- ` And I hope I should have improved , being very anxious to learn , and he very patient to teach me , if the great misfortune of his death ' -- my mother broke down again here , and could get no farther . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Well , well ! ' |										
|said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|-- ` I kept my housekeeping-book regularly , and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night , ' cried my mother in another burst of distress , and breaking down again . |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` Well , well ! ' |										
|said Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` Do n't cry any more . ' |										
|-- ` And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it , except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other , or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines , ' resumed my mother in another burst , and breaking down again . |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` You 'll make yourself ill , ' said Miss Betsey , ` and you know that will not be good either for you or for my god-daughter . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|Come ! |										
|You must n't do it ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|This argument had some share in quieting my mother , though her increasing indisposition had a larger one . |	DEFAULT									
|There was an interval of silence , only broken by Miss Betsey 's occasionally ejaculating ` Ha ! ' |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|as she sat with her feet upon the fender . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` David had bought an annuity for himself with his money , I know , ' said she , by and by . |	David Copperfield	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|` What did he do for you ? ' |	David Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` Mr. Copperfield , ' said my mother , answering with some difficulty , ` was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me . ' |	Mr. Copperfield	DEFAULT								
|` How much ? ' |										
|asked Miss Betsey . |	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield									
|` A hundred and five pounds a year , ' said my mother . |	DEFAULT									
|` He might have done worse , ' said my aunt . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The word was appropriate to the moment . |										
|My mother was so much worse that Peggotty , coming in with the teaboard and candles , and seeing at a glance how ill she was , -- as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enough , -- conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed ; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty , her nephew , who had been for some days past secreted in the house , unknown to my mother , as a special messenger in case of emergency , to fetch the nurse and doctor . |	DEFAULT	Ham Pegotty	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield							
|Those allied powers were considerably astonished , when they arrived within a few minutes of each other , to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance , sitting before the fire , with her bonnet tied over her left arm , stopping her ears with jewellers ' cotton . |	DEFAULT									
|Peggotty knowing nothing about her , and my mother saying nothing about her , she was quite a mystery in the parlour ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers ' cotton in her pocket , and sticking the article in her ears in that way , did not detract from the solemnity of her presence . |	Ham Pegotty	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|The doctor having been upstairs and come down again , and having satisfied himself , I suppose , that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himself having to sit there , face to face , for some hours , laid himself out to be polite and social . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|He was the meekest of his sex , the mildest of little men . |	DEFAULT									
|He sidled in and out of a room , to take up the less space . |	DEFAULT									
|He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet , and more slowly . |	DEFAULT									
|He carried his head on one side , partly in modest depreciation of himself , partly in modest propitiation of everybody else . |	DEFAULT									
|It is nothing to say that he had n't a word to throw at a dog . |	DEFAULT									
|He could n't have thrown a word at a mad dog . |	DEFAULT									
|He might have offered him one gently , or half a one , or a fragment of one ; for he spoke as slowly as he walked ; but he would n't have been rude to him , and he could n't have been quick with him , for any earthly consideration . |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|Mr. Chillip , looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side , and making her a little bow , said , in allusion to the jewellers ' cotton , as he softly touched his left ear : ` Some local irritation , maâ€™am ? ' |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|` What ! ' |										
|replied my aunt , pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork . |	DEFAULT									
|Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness -- as he told my mother afterwards -- that it was a mercy he did n't lose his presence of mind . |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|But he repeated sweetly : ` Some local irritation , maâ€™am ? ' |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|` Nonsense ! ' |										
|replied my aunt , and corked herself again , at one blow . |	DEFAULT									
|Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this , but sit and look at her feebly , as she sat and looked at the fire , until he was called upstairs again . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|After some quarter of an hour 's absence , he returned . |	Mr. Chillip									
|` Well ? ' |										
|said my aunt , taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|` Well , maâ€™am , ' returned Mr. Chillip , ` we are -- we are progressing slowly , maâ€™am . ' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|` Ba -- a -- ah ! ' |										
|said my aunt , with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection . |	DEFAULT									
|And corked herself as before . |	DEFAULT									
|Really -- really -- as Mr. Chillip told my mother , he was almost shocked ; speaking in a professional point of view alone , he was almost shocked . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|After another absence , he again returned . |	DEFAULT									
|` Well ? ' |										
|said my aunt , taking out the cotton on that side again . |	DEFAULT									
|` Well , maâ€™am , ' returned Mr. Chillip , ` we are -- we are progressing slowly , maâ€™am . ' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|` Ya -- a -- ah ! ' |										
|said my aunt . |	DEFAULT									
|With such a snarl at him , that Mr. Chillip absolutely could not bear it . |	Mr. Chillip									
|It was really calculated to break his spirit , he said afterwards . |	Mr. Chillip									
|He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs , in the dark and a strong draught , until he was again sent for . |	Ham Pegotty									
|Ham Peggotty , who went to the national school , and was a very dragon at his catechism , and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness , reported next day , that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour after this , he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey , then walking to and fro in a state of agitation , and pounced upon before he could make his escape . |	Ham Pegotty	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude , from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest . |	Ham Pegotty	Betsey Trotwood Copperfield								
|That , marching him constantly up and down by the collar -LRB- as if he had been taking too much laudanum -RRB- , she , at those times , shook him , rumpled his hair , made light of his linen , stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own , and otherwise tousled and maltreated him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|This was in part confirmed by his aunt , who saw him at half past twelve oâ€™clock , soon after his release , and affirmed that he was then as red as I was . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time . |	Mr. Chillip									
|He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty , and said to my aunt in his meekest manner : ` Well , maâ€™am , I am happy to congratulate you . ' |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|` What upon ? ' |										
|said my aunt , sharply . |	DEFAULT									
|Mr. Chillip was fluttered again , by the extreme severity of my aunt 's manner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile , to mollify her . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|` Mercy on the man , what 's he doing ! ' |	Mr. Chillip									
|cried my aunt , impatiently . |	DEFAULT									
|` Ca n't he speak ? ' |	Mr. Chillip									
|` Be calm , my dear maâ€™am , ' said Mr. Chillip , in his softest accents . |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|` There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , maâ€™am . |	DEFAULT									
|Be calm . ' |										
|It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt did n't shake him , and shake what he had to say , out of him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|She only shook her own head at him , but in a way that made him quail . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip								
|` Well , maâ€™am , ' resumed Mr. Chillip , as soon as he had courage , ` I am happy to congratulate you . |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|All is now over , maâ€™am , and well over . ' |	DEFAULT									
|During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration , my aunt eyed him narrowly . |	Mr. Chillip	DEFAULT								
|` How is she ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|said my aunt , folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them . |	DEFAULT									
|` Well , maâ€™am , she will soon be quite comfortable , I hope , ' returned Mr. Chillip . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Chillip
