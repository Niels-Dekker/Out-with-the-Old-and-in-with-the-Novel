|For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble , by the parish surgeon , it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared ; or , if they had , that being comprised within a couple of pages , they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography , extant in the literature of any age or country . |										
|Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|The fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration , -- a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence ; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next : the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter . |	Oliver Twist									
|Now , if , during this brief period , Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers , anxious aunts , experienced nurses , and doctors of profound wisdom , he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time . |	Oliver Twist									
|There being nobody by , however , but a pauper old woman , who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer ; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract ; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them . |	Oliver Twist									
|The result was , that , after a few struggles , Oliver breathed , sneezed , and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish , by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage , a voice , for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter . |	Oliver Twist									
|As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs , the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead , rustled ; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow ; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words , ` Let me see the child , and die . ' |	Oliver Twist	DEFAULT								
|The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire : giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately . |	DEFAULT									
|As the young woman spoke , he rose , and advancing to the bed 's head , said , with more kindness than might have been expected of him : ` Oh , you must not talk about dying yet . ' |	DEFAULT									
|` Lor bless her dear heart , no ! ' |										
|interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction . |	DEFAULT									
|` Lor bless her dear heart , when she has lived as long as I have , sir , and had thirteen children of her own , and all on 'em dead except two , and them in the wurkus with me , she 'll know better than to take on in that way , bless her dear heart ! |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Think what it is to be a mother , there 's a dear young lamb do . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother 's prospects failed in producing its due effect . |										
|The patient shook her head , and stretched out her hand towards the child . |	DEFAULT									
|The surgeon deposited it in her arms . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead ; passed her hands over her face ; gazed wildly round ; shuddered ; fell back -- and died . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They chafed her breast , hands , and temples ; but the blood had stopped forever . |	DEFAULT									
|They talked of hope and comfort . |										
|They had been strangers too long . |										
|` It 's all over , Mrs. Thingummy ! ' |	Mrs. Thingummy									
|said the surgeon at last . |	DEFAULT									
|` Ah , poor dear , so it is ! ' |										
|said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child . |	DEFAULT									
|` Poor dear ! ' |										
|` You need n't mind sending up to me , if the child cries , nurse , ' said the surgeon , putting on his gloves with great deliberation . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` It 's very likely it _ will _ be troublesome . |										
|Give it a little gruel if it is . ' |										
|He put on his hat , and , pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door , added , ` She was a good-looking girl , too ; where did she come from ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` She was brought here last night , ' replied the old woman , ` by the overseer 's order . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|She was found lying in the street . |	DEFAULT									
|She had walked some distance , for her shoes were worn to pieces ; but where she came from , or where she was going to , nobody knows . ' |	DEFAULT									
|The surgeon leaned over the body , and raised the left hand . |	DEFAULT									
|` The old story , ' he said , shaking his head : ` no wedding-ring , I see . |	DEFAULT									
|Ah ! |										
|Good-night ! ' |										
|The medical gentleman walked away to dinner ; and the nurse , having once more applied herself to the green bottle , sat down on a low chair before the fire , and proceeded to dress the infant . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What an excellent example of the power of dress , young Oliver Twist was ! |	Oliver Twist									
|Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering , he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar ; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society . |	Oliver Twist									
|But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service , he was badged and ticketed , and fell into his place at once -- a parish child -- the orphan of a workhouse -- the humble , half-starved drudge -- to be cuffed and buffeted through the world -- despised by all , and pitied by none . |	Oliver Twist									
|Oliver cried lustily . |	Oliver Twist									
|If he could have known that he was an orphan , left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers , perhaps he would have cried the louder . |	Oliver Twist									
|CHAPTER II TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST 'S GROWTH , EDUCATION , AND BOARD For the next eight or ten months , Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception . |	Oliver Twist									
|He was brought up by hand . |	Oliver Twist									
|The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities . |										
|The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities , whether there was no female then domiciled in ` the house ' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist , the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need . |	Oliver Twist									
|The workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not . |										
|Upon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that Oliver should be ` farmed , ' or , in other words , that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week . |	Oliver Twist									
|Sevenpence-halfpenny 's worth per week is a good round diet for a child ; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable . |										
|The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience ; she knew what was good for children ; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself . |	DEFAULT									
|So , she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use , and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them . |	DEFAULT									
|Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still ; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher . |										
|Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating , and who demonstrated it so well , that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day , and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all , if he had not died , four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air . |										
|Unfortunately for , the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of _ her _ system ; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half-smothered by accident ; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|Occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing -- though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm -- the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance . |										
|But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle ; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside -LRB- which was very probable indeed -RRB- , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted ; which was very self-devotional . |	Beadle									
|Besides , the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm , and always sent the beadle the day before , to say they were going . |	Beadle									
|The children were neat and clean to behold , when _ they _ went ; and what more would the people have ! |										
|It can not be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop . |										
|Oliver Twist 's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child , somewhat diminutive in stature , and decidedly small in circumference . |	Oliver Twist									
|But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver 's breast . |	Oliver Twist									
|It had had plenty of room to expand , thanks to the spare diet of the establishment ; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all . |	Oliver Twist									
|Be this as it may , however , it was his ninth birthday ; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman , who , after participating with him in a sound thrashing , had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry , when Mrs. Mann , the good lady of the house , was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble , the beadle , striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate . |	DEFAULT	Mrs. Mann	Mr. Bumble							
|` Goodness gracious ! |										
|Is that you , Mr. Bumble , sir ? ' |	Mr. Bumble									
|said Mrs. Mann , thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy . ' |	Mrs. Mann									
|-LRB- Susan , take Oliver and them two brats upstairs , and wash 'em directly . -RRB- |	Susan	Oliver Twist								
|-- My heart alive ! |	DEFAULT									
|Mr. Bumble , how glad I am to see you , sure-ly ! ' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bumble								
|Now , Mr. Bumble was a fat man , and a choleric ; so , instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit , he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake , and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle 's . |	Mr. Bumble	Beadle								
|` Lor , only think , ' said Mrs. Mann , running out , -- for the three boys had been removed by this time , -- ` only think of that ! |	Mrs. Mann									
|That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside , on account of them dear children ! |										
|Walk in sir ; walk in , pray , Mr. Bumble , do , sir . ' |	Mr. Bumble									
|Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden , it by no means mollified the beadle . |	Beadle									
|` Do you think this respectful or proper conduct , Mrs. Mann , ' inquired Mr. Bumble , grasping his cane , ` to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate , when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans ? |	Mrs. Mann	Mr. Bumble								
|Are you aweer , Mrs. Mann , that you are , as I may say , a porochial delegate , and a stipendiary ? ' |	Mrs. Mann	Mr. Bumble								
|` I 'm sure Mr. Bumble , that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you , that it was you a coming , ' replied Mrs. Mann with great humility . |	Mr. Bumble	Mrs. Mann								
|Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance . |	Mr. Bumble									
|He had displayed the one , and vindicated the other . |	Mr. Bumble									
|He relaxed . |	DEFAULT									
|` Well , well , Mrs. Mann , ' he replied in a calmer tone ; ` it may be as you say ; it may be . |	Mrs. Mann	DEFAULT								
|Lead the way in , Mrs. Mann , for I come on business , and have something to say . ' |	Beadle	Mrs. Mann								
|Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor ; placed a seat for him ; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him . |	Mrs. Mann	Beadle								
|Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered , glanced complacently at the cocked hat , and smiled . |	Mr. Bumble									
|Yes , he smiled . |	Mr. Bumble									
|Beadles are but men : and Mr. Bumble smiled . |	Mr. Bumble									
|` Now do n't you be offended at what I 'm a going to say , ' observed Mrs. Mann , with captivating sweetness . |	Mrs. Mann	Mr. Bumble								
|` You 've had a long walk , you know , or I would n't mention it . |	Mr. Bumble	Mrs. Mann								
|Now , will you take a little drop of somethink , Mr. Bumble ? ' |	Mr. Bumble									
|` Not a drop . |										
|Nor a drop , ' said Mr. Bumble , waving his right hand in a dignified , but placid manner . ' |	Mr. Bumble									
|I think you will , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it . |	Mrs. Mann	Mr. Bumble								
|` Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . ' |										
|Mr. Bumble coughed . |	Mr. Bumble									
|` Now , just a leetle drop , ' said Mrs. Mann persuasively . |	Mrs. Mann									
|` What is it ? ' |										
|inquired the beadle . |	Beadle									
|` Why , it 's what I 'm obliged to keep a little of in the house , to put into the blessed infants ' Daffy , when they ai n't well , Mr. Bumble , ' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard , and took down a bottle and glass . |	Mr. Bumble	Mrs. Mann								
|` It 's gin . |										
|I 'll not deceive you , Mr. B. It 's gin . ' |	Mrs. Mann	Mr. Bumble								
|` Do you give the children Daffy , Mrs. Mann ? ' |	Mrs. Mann									
|inquired Bumble , following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing . |	Mr. Bumble									
|` Ah , bless 'em , that I do , dear as it is , ' replied the nurse . ' |	DEFAULT									
|I could n't see 'em suffer before my very eyes , you know sir . ' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bumble								
|` No ' ; said Mr. Bumble approvingly ; ` no , you could not . |	Mr. Bumble	Mrs. Mann								
|You are a humane woman , Mrs. Mann . ' |	Mrs. Mann									
|-LRB- Here she set down the glass . -RRB- ' |	Mrs. Mann									
|I shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board , Mrs. Mann . ' |	DEFAULT	Mrs. Mann								
|-LRB- He drew it towards him . -RRB- |	DEFAULT									
|` You feel as a mother , Mrs. Mann . ' |	Mrs. Mann									
|-LRB- He stirred the gin-and-water . -RRB- |	DEFAULT									
|` I -- I drink your health with cheerfulness , Mrs. Mann ' ; and he swallowed half of it . |	DEFAULT	Mrs. Mann								
|` And now about business , ' said the beadle , taking out a leathern pocket-book . |	Beadle									
|` The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist , is nine year old to-day . ' |	Oliver Twist									
|` Bless him ! ' |	Oliver Twist									
|interposed Mrs. Mann , inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron . |	Mrs. Mann									
|` And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound , which was afterwards increased to twenty pound . |										
|Notwithstanding the most superlative , and , I may say , supernat ` ral exertions on the part of this parish , ' said Bumble , ` we have never been able to discover who is his father , or what was his mother 's settlement , name , or condition . ' |	Mr. Bumble	DEFAULT								
|Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment ; but added , after a moment 's reflection , ` How comes he to have any name at all , then ? ' |	Mrs. Mann	DEFAULT								
|The beadle drew himself up with great pride , and said , ' I inwented it . ' |	Beadle									
|` You , Mr. Bumble ! ' |	Mr. Bumble									
|` I , Mrs. Mann . |	Mr. Bumble	Mrs. Mann								
|We name our fondlings in alphabetical order . |										
|The last was a S , -- Swubble , I named him . |	Swubble	DEFAULT								
|This was a T , -- Twist , I named _ him _ . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|The next one comes will be Unwin , and the next Vilkins . |	Unwin	Vilkins								
|I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet , and all the way through it again , when we come to Z. ' ` Why , you 're quite a literary character , sir ! ' |	DEFAULT	Mrs. Mann								
|said Mrs. Mann . |	Mrs. Mann									
|` Well , well , ' said the beadle , evidently gratified with the compliment ; ` perhaps I may be . |	Beadle									
|Perhaps I may be , Mrs. Mann . ' |	Beadle	Mrs. Mann								
|He finished the gin-and-water , and added , ` Oliver being now too old to remain here , the board have determined to have him back into the house . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|I have come out myself to take him there . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|So let me see him at once . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` I 'll fetch him directly , ' said Mrs. Mann , leaving the room for that purpose . |	Mrs. Mann	Oliver Twist								
|Oliver , having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands , removed , as could be scrubbed off in one washing , was led into the room by his benevolent protectress . |	Oliver Twist									
|` Make a bow to the gentleman , Oliver , ' said Mrs. Mann . |	Oliver Twist	Mrs. Mann								
|Oliver made a bow , which was divided between the beadle on the chair , and the cocked hat on the table . |	Oliver Twist	Beadle								
|` Will you go along with me , Oliver ? ' |	Oliver Twist	Mr. Bumble								
|said Mr. Bumble , in a majestic voice . |	Mr. Bumble									
|Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness , when , glancing upward , he caught sight of Mrs. Mann , who had got behind the beadle 's chair , and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance . |	Oliver Twist	Mrs. Mann	Beadle							
|He took the hint at once , for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection . |	Beadle									
|` Will she go with me ? ' |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|inquired poor Oliver . |	Oliver Twist									
|` No , she ca n't , ' replied Mr. Bumble . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bumble								
|` But she 'll come and see you sometimes . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|This was no very great consolation to the child . |										
|Young as he was , however , he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away . |	DEFAULT									
|It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes . |	Oliver Twist									
|Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry ; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed . |	Oliver Twist									
|Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces , and what Oliver wanted a great deal more , a piece of bread and butter , less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse . |	Mrs. Mann	Oliver Twist								
|With the slice of bread in his hand , and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head , Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years . |	Oliver Twist	Mr. Bumble								
|And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief , as the cottage-gate closed after him . |	Oliver Twist									
|Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind , they were the only friends he had ever known ; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world , sank into the child 's heart for the first time . |	Oliver Twist									
|Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides ; little Oliver , firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff , trotted beside him , inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were ` nearly there . ' |	Mr. Bumble	Oliver Twist								
|To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies ; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated ; and he was once again a beadle . |	Mr. Bumble									
|Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour , and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread , when Mr. Bumble , who had handed him over to the care of an old woman , returned ; and , telling him it was a board night , informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith . |	Oliver Twist	Mr. Bumble								
|Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was , Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence , and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry . |	Oliver Twist									
|He had no time to think about the matter , however ; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head , with his cane , to wake him up : and another on the back to make him lively : and bidding him to follow , conducted him into a large white-washed room , where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table . |	Oliver Twist	Mr. Bumble								
|At the top of the table , seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest , was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round , red face . |	DEFAULT									
|` Bow to the board , ' said Bumble . |	Mr. Bumble									
|Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes ; and seeing no board but the table , fortunately bowed to that . |	Oliver Twist									
|` What 's your name , boy ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|said the gentleman in the high chair . |	DEFAULT									
|Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen , which made him tremble : and the beadle gave him another tap behind , which made him cry . |	Oliver Twist									
|These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice ; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool . |	Oliver Twist	DEFAULT								
|Which was a capital way of raising his spirits , and putting him quite at his ease . |	DEFAULT									
|` Boy , ' said the gentleman in the high chair , ` listen to me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|You know you 're an orphan , I suppose ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` What 's that , sir ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|inquired poor Oliver . |	Oliver Twist									
|` The boy _ is _ a fool -- I thought he was , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|` Hush ! ' |										
|said the gentleman who had spoken first . |	DEFAULT									
|` You know you 've got no father or mother , and that you were brought up by the parish , do n't you ? ' |	Oliver Twist									
|` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver , weeping bitterly . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|` What are you crying for ? ' |	Oliver Twist									
|inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat . |	DEFAULT									
|And to be sure it was very extraordinary . |										
|What _ could _ the boy be crying for ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|I hope you say your prayers every night , ' said another gentleman in a gruff voice ; ` and pray for the people who feed you , and take care of you -- like a Christian . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Yes , sir , ' stammered the boy . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right . |	DEFAULT									
|It would have been very like a Christian , and a marvellously good Christian too , if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of _ him _ . |	Oliver Twist									
|But he had n't , because nobody had taught him . |	Oliver Twist									
|` Well ! |										
|You have come here to be educated , and taught a useful trade , ' said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair . |	DEFAULT									
|` So you 'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o'clock , ' added the surly one in the white waistcoat . |	Oliver Twist	DEFAULT								
|For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum , Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle , and was then hurried away to a large ward ; where , on a rough , hard bed , he sobbed himself to sleep . |	Oliver Twist	Beadle								
|What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England ! |										
|They let the paupers go to sleep ! |										
|Poor Oliver ! |	Oliver Twist									
|He little thought , as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him , that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes . |	Oliver Twist									
|But they had . |										
|And this was it : The members of this board were very sage , deep , philosophical men ; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse , they found out at once , what ordinary folks would never have discovered -- the poor people liked it ! |										
|It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes ; a tavern where there was nothing to pay ; a public breakfast , dinner , tea , and supper all the year round ; a brick and mortar elysium , where it was all play and no work . |										
|` Oho ! ' |										
|said the board , looking very knowing ; ` we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . ' |										
|So , they established the rule , that all poor people should have the alternative -LRB- for they would compel nobody , not they -RRB- , of being starved by a gradual process in the house , or by a quick one out of it . |										
|With this view , they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water ; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal ; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day , with an onion twice a week , and half a roll of Sundays . |										
|They made a great many other wise and humane regulations , having reference to the ladies , which it is not necessary to repeat ; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people , in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors ' Commons ; and , instead of compelling a man to support his family , as they had theretofore done , took his family away from him , and made him a bachelor ! |										
|There is no saying how many applicants for relief , under these last two heads , might have started up in all classes of society , if it had not been coupled with the workhouse ; but the board were long-headed men , and had provided for this difficulty . |										
|The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel ; and that frightened people . |										
|For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed , the system was in full operation . |	Oliver Twist									
|It was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker 's bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two 's gruel . |										
|But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers ; and the board were in ecstasies . |										
|The room in which the boys were fed , was a large stone hall , with a copper at one end : out of which the master , dressed in an apron for the purpose , and assisted by one or two women , ladled the gruel at mealtimes . |										
|Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer , and no more -- except on occasions of great public rejoicing , when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides . |	DEFAULT									
|The bowls never wanted washing . |										
|The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again ; and when they had performed this operation -LRB- which never took very long , the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls -RRB- , they would sit staring at the copper , with such eager eyes , as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed ; employing themselves , meanwhile , in sucking their fingers most assiduously , with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon . |										
|Boys have generally excellent appetites . |										
|Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months : at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger , that one boy , who was tall for his age , and had n't been used to that sort of thing -LRB- for his father had kept a small cook-shop -RRB- , hinted darkly to his companions , that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem , he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him , who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age . |	Oliver Twist									
|He had a wild , hungry eye ; and they implicitly believed him . |	Oliver Twist									
|A council was held ; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening , and ask for more ; and it fell to Oliver Twist . |	Oliver Twist									
|The evening arrived ; the boys took their places . |										
|The master , in his cook 's uniform , stationed himself at the copper ; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him ; the gruel was served out ; and a long grace was said over the short commons . |	DEFAULT									
|The gruel disappeared ; the boys whispered each other , and winked at Oliver ; while his next neighbors nudged him . |	Oliver Twist									
|Child as he was , he was desperate with hunger , and reckless with misery . |	Oliver Twist									
|He rose from the table ; and advancing to the master , basin and spoon in hand , said : somewhat alarmed at his own temerity : ` Please , sir , I want some more . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The master was a fat , healthy man ; but he turned very pale . |	DEFAULT									
|He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds , and then clung for support to the copper . |	DEFAULT									
|The assistants were paralysed with wonder ; the boys with fear . |										
|` What ! ' |										
|said the master at length , in a faint voice . |	DEFAULT									
|` Please , sir , ' replied Oliver , ' I want some more . ' |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|The master aimed a blow at Oliver 's head with the ladle ; pinioned him in his arm ; and shrieked aloud for the beadle . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist	Beadle							
|The board were sitting in solemn conclave , when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement , and addressing the gentleman in the high chair , said , ` Mr. Limbkins , I beg your pardon , sir ! |	Mr. Bumble	Mr. Limbkins								
|Oliver Twist has asked for more ! ' |	Oliver Twist									
|There was a general start . |										
|Horror was depicted on every countenance . |										
|` For _ more _ ! ' |										
|said Mr. Limbkins . |	Mr. Limbkins									
|` Compose yourself , Bumble , and answer me distinctly . |	Mr. Bumble	Mr. Limbkins								
|Do I understand that he asked for more , after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` He did , sir , ' replied Bumble . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bumble								
|` That boy will be hung , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I know that boy will be hung . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman 's opinion . |										
|An animated discussion took place . |										
|Oliver was ordered into instant confinement ; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate , offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish . |	Oliver Twist									
|In other words , five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade , business , or calling . ' |	Oliver Twist									
|I never was more convinced of anything in my life , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning : ' I never was more convinced of anything in my life , than I am that that boy will come to be hung . ' |	DEFAULT									
|As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not , I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative -LRB- supposing it to possess any at all -RRB- , if I ventured to hint just yet , whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no . |	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist								
|CHAPTER III RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more , Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board . |	Oliver Twist									
|It appears , at first sight not unreasonable to suppose , that , if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat , he would have established that sage individual 's prophetic character , once and for ever , by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall , and attaching himself to the other . |										
|To the performance of this feat , however , there was one obstacle : namely , that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury , had been , for all future times and ages , removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board , in council assembled : solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals . |										
|There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver 's youth and childishness . |	Oliver Twist									
|He only cried bitterly all day ; and , when the long , dismal night came on , spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness , and crouching in the corner , tried to sleep : ever and anon waking with a start and tremble , and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall , as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him . |	Oliver Twist									
|Let it not be supposed by the enemies of ` the system , ' that , during the period of his solitary incarceration , Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise , the pleasure of society , or the advantages of religious consolation . |	Oliver Twist									
|As for exercise , it was nice cold weather , and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump , in a stone yard , in the presence of Mr. Bumble , who prevented his catching cold , and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame , by repeated applications of the cane . |	Oliver Twist	Mr. Bumble								
|As for society , he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined , and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example . |	Oliver Twist									
|And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation , he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time , and there permitted to listen to , and console his mind with , a general supplication of the boys , containing a special clause , therein inserted by authority of the board , in which they entreated to be made good , virtuous , contented , and obedient , and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist : whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness , and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself . |	Oliver Twist									
|It chanced one morning , while Oliver 's affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state , that Mr. Gamfield , chimney-sweep , went his way down the High Street , deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent , for which his landlord had become rather pressing . |	Oliver Twist	Mr. Gamfield								
|Mr. Gamfield 's most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount ; and , in a species of arithmetical desperation , he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey , when passing the workhouse , his eyes encountered the bill on the gate . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|` Wo -- o ! ' |										
|said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction : wondering , probably , whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden ; so , without noticing the word of command , he jogged onward . |										
|Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally , but more particularly on his eyes ; and , running after him , bestowed a blow on his head , which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey 's . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|Then , catching hold of the bridle , he gave his jaw a sharp wrench , by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master ; and by these means turned him round . |	Mr. Gamfield	DEFAULT								
|He then gave him another blow on the head , just to stun him till he came back again . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Having completed these arrangements , he walked up to the gate , to read the bill . |	DEFAULT									
|The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him , after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room . |	DEFAULT									
|Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey , he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill , for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted . |	Mr. Gamfield	DEFAULT	Oliver Twist							
|Mr. Gamfield smiled , too , as he perused the document ; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for ; and , as to the boy with which it was encumbered , Mr. Gamfield , knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was , well knew he would be a nice small pattern , just the very thing for register stoves . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|So , he spelt the bill through again , from beginning to end ; and then , touching his fur cap in token of humility , accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|` This here boy , sir , wot the parish wants to ` prentis , ' said Mr. Gamfield . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Gamfield								
|` Ay , my man , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , with a condescending smile . |	DEFAULT									
|` What of him ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade , in a good ` spectable chimbley-sweepin ' bisness , ' said Mr. Gamfield , ' I wants a ` prentis , and I am ready to take him . ' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Gamfield								
|` Walk in , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . |	DEFAULT									
|Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind , to give the donkey another blow on the head , and another wrench of the jaw , as a caution not to run away in his absence , followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him . |	Mr. Gamfield	Oliver Twist								
|` It 's a nasty trade , ' said Mr. Limbkins , when Gamfield had again stated his wish . |	Mr. Limbkins	Mr. Gamfield								
|` Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now , ' said another gentleman . |	DEFAULT									
|` That 's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make 'em come down again , ' said Gamfield ; ` that 's all smoke , and no blaze ; vereas smoke ai n't o ' no use at all in making a boy come down , for it only sinds him to sleep , and that 's wot he likes . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|Boys is wery obstinit , and wery lazy , Gen ` l'men , and there 's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em come down vith a run . |										
|It 's humane too , gen ` l'men , acause , even if they 've stuck in the chimbley , roasting their feet makes 'em struggle to hextricate theirselves . ' |										
|The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation ; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Limbkins								
|The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes , but in so low a tone , that the words ` saving of expenditure , ' ` looked well in the accounts , ' ` have a printed report published , ' were alone audible . |										
|These only chanced to be heard , indeed , or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis . |										
|At length the whispering ceased ; and the members of the board , having resumed their seats and their solemnity , Mr. Limbkins said : ` We have considered your proposition , and we do n't approve of it . ' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Limbkins								
|` Not at all , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . |	DEFAULT									
|` Decidedly not , ' added the other members . |										
|As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already , it occurred to him that the board had , perhaps , in some unaccountable freak , taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|It was very unlike their general mode of doing business , if they had ; but still , as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour , he twisted his cap in his hands , and walked slowly from the table . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|` So you wo n't let me have him , gen ` l'men ? ' |	Mr. Gamfield	DEFAULT								
|said Mr. Gamfield , pausing near the door . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|` No , ' replied Mr. Limbkins ; ` at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered . ' |	Mr. Limbkins	Mr. Gamfield								
|Mr. Gamfield 's countenance brightened , as , with a quick step , he returned to the table , and said , ` What 'll you give , gen ` l'men ? |	Mr. Gamfield									
|Come ! |										
|Do n't be too hard on a poor man . |										
|What 'll you give ? ' ' |	Mr. Limbkins									
|I should say , three pound ten was plenty , ' said Mr. Limbkins . |	Mr. Limbkins									
|` Ten shillings too much , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . |	DEFAULT									
|` Come ! ' |										
|said Gamfield ; ` say four pound , gen ` l'men . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|Say four pound , and you 've got rid of him for good and all . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|There ! ' |										
|` Three pound ten , ' repeated Mr. Limbkins , firmly . |	Mr. Limbkins									
|` Come ! |										
|I 'll split the diff ` erence , gen ` l'men , ' urged Gamfield . |	Mr. Gamfield									
|` Three pound fifteen . ' |										
|` Not a farthing more , ' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins . |	Mr. Limbkins									
|` You 're desperate hard upon me , gen ` l'men , ' said Gamfield , wavering . |	Mr. Gamfield
