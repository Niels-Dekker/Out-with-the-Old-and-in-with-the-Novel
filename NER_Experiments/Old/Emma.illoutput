mistress O

his O
house O
from O
a O
very O
early O
period O

Her O
mother O

died O
too O
long O
ago O
for O
her O
to O
have O
more O
than O
an O
indistinct O
remembrance O
of O
her O
caresses O

and O
her O
place O

been O
supplied O
by O
an O
excellent O
woman O

governess O

who O
had O
fallen O
little O
short O
of O
a O
mother O
in O
affection O

Sixteen O
years O
had O
Miss O
Taylor PER
been O
in O
Mr. O
Woodhouse PER

family O
, O
less O
as O
a O
governess O

a O
friend O

very O
fond O
of O
both O
daughters O

particularly O
of O
Emma PER

Between O

them O

it O
was O
more O
the O
intimacy O

Even O
before O
Miss O
Taylor PER
had O
ceased O
to O
hold O
the O
nominal O
office O
of O
governess O

the O
mildness O
of O
her O
temper O
had O
hardly O
allowed O
her O
to O
impose O
any O
restraint O
; O
and O
the O
shadow O
of O
authority O
being O
now O
long O

just O
what O

; O
highly O

Miss O

judgment O

directed O
chiefly O
by O
her O
own O
. O
The O
real O
evils O
, O
indeed O
, O
of O
Emma PER
's O
situation O
were O
the O
power O
of O
having O
rather O
too O
much O
her O
own O
way O
, O
and O
a O
disposition O
to O
think O
a O
little O
too O
well O
of O
herself O
; O
these O
were O
the O
disadvantages O
which O
threatened O
alloy O
to O
her O
many O
enjoyments O

The O
danger O
, O
however O
, O
was O
at O

so O
unperceived O

that O
they O
did O
not O
by O
any O
means O
rank O
as O
misfortunes O
with O
her O

Sorrow O
came O

a O
gentle O
sorrow O

not O
at O
all O

the O
shape O
of O
any O
disagreeable O
consciousness O

Miss O

It O
was O
Miss O

loss O
which O
first O
brought O
grief O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
wedding-day O
of O
this O
beloved O
friend O
that O
Emma PER
first O
sat O
in O
mournful O
thought O

with O
no O
prospect O
of O
a O
third O
to O
cheer O
a O
long O
evening O

Her O
father O
composed O
himself O
to O
sleep O
after O
dinner O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
she O
had O
then O
only O
to O
sit O

of O
what O
she O

lost O

The O
event O

every O
promise O

happiness O
for O
her O

Mr. O

a O
man O
of O
unexceptionable O
character O

easy O
fortune O

suitable O
age O

and O
pleasant O
manners O

and O
there O
was O
some O
satisfaction O
in O
considering O
with O
what O
self-denying O
, O
generous O
friendship O
she O
had O
always O
wished O
and O
promoted O
the O
match O

but O
it O
was O
a O
black O
morning O

work O
for O
her O

The O
want O
of O
Miss O

be O
felt O
every O
hour O
of O
every O
day O

her O
past O
kindness O

the O
kindness O

the O
affection O
of O
sixteen O
years O

how O
she O
had O
taught O

how O
she O
had O
played O
with O
her O
from O
five O
years O

how O
she O

devoted O
all O
her O
powers O

her O
in O
health O

how O
nursed O
her O
through O
the O
various O
illnesses O
of O
childhood O

A O
large O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
was O
owing O
here O
; O

the O
intercourse O
of O
the O
last O
seven O
years O

the O
equal O
footing O

perfect O
unreserve O

soon O
followed O

on O
their O
being O
left O
to O
each O
other O

was O
yet O
a O
dearer O

tenderer O
recollection O

She O
had O
been O
a O
friend O

companion O
such O
as O
few O
possessed O

intelligent O

one O

who O

such O
an O
affection O

never O

How O
was O
she O
to O
bear O
the O
change O
? O

It O
was O
true O
that O
her O
friend O

going O
only O
half O
a O
mile O

Emma PER

the O
difference O
between O

Mrs. O

only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them O

and O
a O
Miss O

in O
the O
house O
; O
and O
with O
all O
her O
advantages O

natural O
and O
domestic O
, O
she O
was O
now O
in O
great O
danger O
of O
suffering O
from O
intellectual O
solitude O

She O
dearly O
loved O
her O
father O

he O
was O
no O

her O

He O

not O

was O
now O
some O
time O

begun O

as O
it O

shew O
him O
how O
delightful O

himself O

that O

his O
fond O

one O
of O

such O

an O

a O
most O

addition O

every O
expression O

her O

herself O

long O
enough O
to O
know O
how O
fortunate O

the O
only O

for O
