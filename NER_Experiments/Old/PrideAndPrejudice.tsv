|However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters . |										
|`` My dear Mr. Bennet , '' said his lady to him one day , `` have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? '' |	Mr. Bennet	DEFAULT								
|Mr. Bennet replied that he had not . |	Mr. Bennet									
|`` But it is , '' returned she ; `` for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . '' |	DEFAULT	Mrs. Long								
|Mr. Bennet made no answer . |	Mr. Bennet									
|`` Do you not want to know who has taken it ? '' |	Mr. Bennet									
|cried his wife impatiently . |	DEFAULT									
|`` _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|This was invitation enough . |										
|`` Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Mrs. Long	DEFAULT	Mr. Morris					
|`` What is his name ? '' |	Mr. Bingley									
|`` Bingley . '' |	Mr. Bingley									
|`` Is he married or single ? '' |	Mr. Bingley									
|`` Oh ! |										
|Single , my dear , to be sure ! |	DEFAULT									
|A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . |										
|What a fine thing for our girls ! '' |										
|`` How so ? |										
|How can it affect them ? '' |										
|`` My dear Mr. Bennet , '' replied his wife , `` how can you be so tiresome ! |	Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Bennet								
|You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . '' |	Mr. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet								
|`` Is that his design in settling here ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Design ! |										
|Nonsense , how can you talk so ! |	DEFAULT									
|But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I see no occasion for that . |	DEFAULT									
|You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . '' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bingley								
|`` My dear , you flatter me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . |	DEFAULT									
|When a woman has five grown-up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . '' |										
|`` In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . '' |										
|`` But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Mr. Bingley							
|`` It is more than I engage for , I assure you . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` But consider your daughters . |	DEFAULT									
|Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . |										
|Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers . |	William	Lady Lucas	DEFAULT							
|Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him if you do not . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` You are over-scrupulous , surely . |	DEFAULT									
|I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . '' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT	Miss Elizabeth Bennet						
|`` I desire you will do no such thing . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good-humoured as Lydia . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	DEFAULT	Jane	Miss Lydia Bennet						
|But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . '' |	DEFAULT	Miss Elizabeth Bennet								
|`` They have none of them much to recommend them , '' replied he ; `` they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . '' |	Mr. Bennet	Miss Elizabeth Bennet								
|`` Mr. Bennet , how _ can _ you abuse your own children in such a way ? |	Mr. Bennet									
|You take delight in vexing me . |	Mr. Bennet	DEFAULT								
|You have no compassion for my poor nerves . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` You mistake me , my dear . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I have a high respect for your nerves . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They are my old friends . |	DEFAULT									
|I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Ah , you do not know what I suffer . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . '' |	Mr. Bennet									
|Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . |	Mr. Bennet									
|_ Her _ mind was less difficult to develop . |	Mrs. Bennet									
|She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . |	DEFAULT									
|When she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous . |	DEFAULT									
|The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . |	DEFAULT									
|Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley . |	Mr. Bennet	Mr. Bingley								
|He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it . |	Mr. Bennet	Mr. Bingley								
|It was then disclosed in the following manner . |										
|Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with : `` I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . '' |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bingley	Miss Elizabeth Bennet							
|`` We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , '' said her mother resentfully , `` since we are not to visit . '' |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bingley								
|`` But you forget , mamma , '' said Elizabeth , `` that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . '' |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bingley	Mrs. Long	DEFAULT						
|`` I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Long								
|She has two nieces of her own . |	Mrs. Long									
|She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` No more have I , '' said Mr. Bennet ; `` and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . '' |	Mr. Bennet	Mrs. Bennet	DEFAULT							
|Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply , but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . |	Mrs. Bennet									
|`` Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake ! |	Kitty									
|Have a little compassion on my nerves . |	DEFAULT									
|You tear them to pieces . '' |	Kitty									
|`` Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , '' said her father ; `` she times them ill . '' |	Kitty	DEFAULT								
|`` I do not cough for my own amusement , '' replied Kitty fretfully . |	Kitty									
|`` When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? '' |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet									
|`` To-morrow fortnight . '' |										
|`` Aye , so it is , '' cried her mother , `` and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . '' |	Mrs. Long	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT							
|`` Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . '' |	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|`` Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? '' |	Miss Bingley	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT							
|`` I honour your circumspection . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bennet								
|A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . |										
|One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . |										
|But if _ we _ do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . '' |	Mrs. Long	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|The girls stared at their father . |										
|Mrs. Bennet said only , `` Nonsense , nonsense ! '' |	Mrs. Bennet									
|`` What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? '' |										
|cried he . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? |	DEFAULT									
|I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What say you , Mary ? |	Mary									
|For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . '' |	Mary	DEFAULT								
|Mary wished to say something sensible , but knew not how . |	Mary									
|`` While Mary is adjusting her ideas , '' he continued , `` let us return to Mr. Bingley . '' |	Mary	DEFAULT	Mr. Bingley							
|`` I am sick of Mr. Bingley , '' cried his wife . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT							
|`` I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did not you tell me that before ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . |	Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Bennet								
|`` How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! |	Mr. Bennet	DEFAULT								
|But I knew I should persuade you at last . |	Mr. Bennet	DEFAULT								
|I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . |	DEFAULT									
|Well , how pleased I am ! |	DEFAULT									
|and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . '' |	Mr. Bennet									
|`` Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , '' said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . |	Mr. Bennet	Kitty								
|`` What an excellent father you have , girls ! '' |										
|said she , when the door was shut . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|At our time of life it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything . |	Miss Lydia Bennet	DEFAULT								
|Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . '' |	Miss Lydia Bennet	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT							
|`` Oh ! '' |										
|said Lydia stoutly , `` I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I 'm the tallest . '' |	Miss Lydia Bennet									
|The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet 's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bennet								
|Chapter 3 Not all that Mrs. Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject , was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley . |	Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Bingley								
|They attacked him in various ways -- with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all , and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour , Lady Lucas . |	Mr. Bingley	Lady Lucas								
|Her report was highly favourable . |	Lady Lucas									
|Sir William had been delighted with him . |	William	DEFAULT								
|He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . |	William									
|Nothing could be more delightful ! |										
|To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley 's heart were entertained . |	Mr. Bingley									
|`` If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , '' said Mrs. Bennet to her husband , `` and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . '' |	Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Bennet								
|In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet 's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Bennet								
|He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . |	Mr. Bingley									
|The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat , and rode a black horse . |										
|An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . |	Mrs. Bennet									
|Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and , consequently , unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc. . |	Mr. Bingley									
|Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted . |	Mrs. Bennet									
|She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . |	Mrs. Bennet	Mr. Bingley								
|Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . |	Lady Lucas	Mr. Bingley								
|The girls grieved over such a number of ladies , but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London -- his five sisters and a cousin . |	Mr. Bingley									
|And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether -- Mr. Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . |	Mr. Bingley									
|Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . |	Mr. Bingley									
|His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . |	Mr. Bingley									
|His brother-in-law , Mr. Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy	Mr. Hurst							
|The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud ; to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . |	Mr. Darcy	Mr. Bingley								
|Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . |	Mr. Bingley									
|Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . |										
|What a contrast between him and his friend ! |	DEFAULT									
|Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . |	Mr. Darcy	Mrs. Hurst	Miss Bingley							
|His character was decided . |	Mr. Darcy									
|He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again . |	DEFAULT									
|Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters . |	DEFAULT	Mrs. Bennet								
|Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy	Mr. Bingley							
|`` Come , Darcy , '' said he , `` I must have you dance . |	Mr. Darcy	Mr. Bingley								
|I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . |	Mr. Darcy	DEFAULT								
|You had much better dance . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I certainly shall not . |	DEFAULT									
|You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable . |										
|Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . '' |	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT								
|`` I would not be so fastidious as you are , '' cried Mr. Bingley , `` for a kingdom ! |	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT								
|Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . '' |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy								
|`` _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , '' said Mr. Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . |	Mr. Darcy	Miss Lydia Bennet								
|`` Oh ! |										
|She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Which do you mean ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said : `` She is tolerable , but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . |	DEFAULT	Miss Elizabeth Bennet								
|You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . '' |	Mr. Bingley	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	DEFAULT							
|Mr. Bingley followed his advice . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy								
|Mr. Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him . |	Mr. Darcy	Miss Elizabeth Bennet								
|She told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet									
|The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . |										
|Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party . |	Mrs. Bennet									
|Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . |	Mr. Bingley	Mrs. Bennet								
|Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . |	Jane	DEFAULT								
|Elizabeth felt Jane 's pleasure . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Jane								
|Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . |	Mary	Miss Bingley	Catherine	Miss Lydia Bennet						
|They returned , therefore , in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . |										
|They found Mr. Bennet still up . |	Mr. Bennet									
|With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . |	Mr. Bennet									
|He had rather hoped that his wife 's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Oh ! |										
|my dear Mr. Bennet , '' as she entered the room , `` we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Bennet								
|I wish you had been there . |	Mr. Bennet	Jane								
|Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . |	Jane									
|Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice ! |	Jane	Mr. Bingley								
|Only think of _ that _ , my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ! |	Mr. Bingley	DEFAULT								
|and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . |	DEFAULT	Miss Lucas								
|I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ! |	Miss Lucas	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|But , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Jane						
|So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . |	DEFAULT	Jane								
|Then the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _ Boulanger _ -- '' `` If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , '' cried her husband impatiently , `` he would not have danced half so much ! |	Miss King	Maria Lucas	Jane	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	DEFAULT	DEFAULT				
|For God 's sake , say no more of his partners . |	DEFAULT									
|Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance ! '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Oh ! |										
|my dear , I am quite delighted with him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He is so excessively handsome ! |	DEFAULT									
|And his sisters are charming women . |	DEFAULT									
|I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . |	DEFAULT									
|I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst 's gown -- '' Here she was interrupted again . |	Mr. Bennet	Mrs. Hurst								
|Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery . |	Mr. Bennet									
|She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Darcy								
|`` But I can assure you , '' she added , `` that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Mr. Darcy	Miss Elizabeth Bennet						
|So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! |	DEFAULT									
|He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! |	DEFAULT									
|Not handsome enough to dance with ! |										
|I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set-downs . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|I quite detest the man . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him . |	Jane	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Bingley							
|`` He is just what a young man ought to be , '' said she , `` sensible , good-humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! |	Mr. Bingley	Jane								
|-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! '' |										
|`` He is also handsome , '' replied Elizabeth , `` which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . |	DEFAULT	Miss Elizabeth Bennet								
|His character is thereby complete . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I did not expect such a compliment . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Did not you ? |	DEFAULT									
|I did for you . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|But that is one great difference between us . |										
|Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What could be more natural than his asking you again ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|No thanks to his gallantry for that . |	DEFAULT									
|Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|You have liked many a stupider person . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Dear Lizzy ! '' |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet									
|`` Oh ! |										
|you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . |	DEFAULT									
|You never see a fault in anybody . |	DEFAULT									
|All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . |	DEFAULT									
|I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I know you do ; and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! |	DEFAULT									
|Affectation of candour is common enough -- one meets with it everywhere . |										
|But to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of everybody 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone . |	DEFAULT									
|And so you like this man 's sisters , too , do you ? |	DEFAULT									
|Their manners are not equal to his . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Certainly not -- at first . |										
|But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . |	DEFAULT									
|Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . '' |	Miss Bingley	DEFAULT								
|Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet									
|They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it , but proud and conceited . |										
|They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank , and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . |										
|They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . |										
|Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . |	Mr. Bingley									
|Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . |	Mr. Bingley									
|His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but , though he was now only established as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table -- nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . |	Mr. Bingley	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Hurst	Mr. Hurst						
|Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . |	Mr. Bingley									
|He did look at it , and into it for half-an-hour -- was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . |	Mr. Bingley									
|Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of great opposition of character . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy								
|Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy								
|On the strength of Darcy 's regard , Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgement the highest opinion . |	Mr. Darcy	Mr. Bingley								
|In understanding , Darcy was the superior . |	Mr. Darcy									
|Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy								
|He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well-bred , were not inviting . |	Mr. Darcy									
|In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . |	DEFAULT									
|Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offense . |	Mr. Bingley	Mr. Darcy								
|The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . |										
|Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and , as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . |	Mr. Bingley	Miss Elizabeth Bennet								
|Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . |	Mr. Darcy									
|Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mr. Darcy								
|Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they would not object to know more of . |	Mrs. Hurst									
|Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . |	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	DEFAULT
