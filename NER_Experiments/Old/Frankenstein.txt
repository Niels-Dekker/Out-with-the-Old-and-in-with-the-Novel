I arrived here yesterday , and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking . 
I am already far north of London , and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh , I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks , which braces my nerves and fills me with delight . 
Do you understand this feeling ? 
This breeze , which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing , gives me a foretaste of those icy climes . 
Inspirited by this wind of promise , my daydreams become more fervent and vivid . 
I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation ; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight . 
There , Margaret , the sun is forever visible , its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour . 
There -- for with your leave , my sister , I will put some trust in preceding navigators -- there snow and frost are banished ; and , sailing over a calm sea , we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe . 
Its productions and features may be without example , as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes . 
What may not be expected in a country of eternal light ? 
I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever . 
I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited , and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man . 
These are my enticements , and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat , with his holiday mates , on an expedition of discovery up his native river . 
But supposing all these conjectures to be false , you can not contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind , to the last generation , by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries , to reach which at present so many months are requisite ; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet , which , if at all possible , can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine . 
These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter , and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven , for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose -- a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye . 
This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years . 
I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole . 
You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas ' library . 
My education was neglected , yet I was passionately fond of reading . 
These volumes were my study day and night , and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt , as a child , on learning that my father 's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life . 
These visions faded when I perused , for the first time , those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven . 
I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation ; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated . 
You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment . 
But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin , and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent . 
Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking . 
I can , even now , remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise . 
I commenced by inuring my body to hardship . 
I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea ; I voluntarily endured cold , famine , thirst , and want of sleep ; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics , the theory of medicine , and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage . 
Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler , and acquitted myself to admiration . 
I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness , so valuable did he consider my services . 
And now , dear Margaret , do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose ? 
My life might have been passed in ease and luxury , but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path . 
Oh , that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative ! 
My courage and my resolution is firm ; but my hopes fluctuate , and my spirits are often depressed . 
I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage , the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude : I am required not only to raise the spirits of others , but sometimes to sustain my own , when theirs are failing . 
This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia . 
They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges ; the motion is pleasant , and , in my opinion , far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach . 
The cold is not excessive , if you are wrapped in furs -- a dress which I have already adopted , for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours , when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins . 
I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel . 
I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks ; and my intention is to hire a ship there , which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner , and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing . 
I do not intend to sail until the month of June ; and when shall I return ? 
Ah , dear sister , how can I answer this question ? 
If I succeed , many , many months , perhaps years , will pass before you and I may meet . 
If I fail , you will see me again soon , or never . 
Farewell , my dear , excellent Margaret . 
Heaven shower down blessings on you , and save me , that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness . 
Your affectionate brother , R. Walton Letter 2 Archangel , 28th March , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England How slowly the time passes here , encompassed as I am by frost and snow ! 
Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise . 
I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors ; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage . 
But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy , and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil , I have no friend , Margaret : when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success , there will be none to participate my joy ; if I am assailed by disappointment , no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection . 
I shall commit my thoughts to paper , it is true ; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling . 
I desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me , whose eyes would reply to mine . 
You may deem me romantic , my dear sister , but I bitterly feel the want of a friend . 
I have no one near me , gentle yet courageous , possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind , whose tastes are like my own , to approve or amend my plans . 
How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother ! 
I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties . 
But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated : for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas ' books of voyages . 
At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country ; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country . 
Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen . 
It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent , but they want -LRB- as the painters call it -RRB- KEEPING ; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic , and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind . 
Well , these are useless complaints ; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean , nor even here in Archangel , among merchants and seamen . 
Yet some feelings , unallied to the dross of human nature , beat even in these rugged bosoms . 
My lieutenant , for instance , is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise ; he is madly desirous of glory , or rather , to word my phrase more characteristically , of advancement in his profession . 
He is an Englishman , and in the midst of national and professional prejudices , unsoftened by cultivation , retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity . 
I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel ; finding that he was unemployed in this city , I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise . 
The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline . 
This circumstance , added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage , made me very desirous to engage him . 
A youth passed in solitude , my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage , has so refined the groundwork of my character that I can not overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship : I have never believed it to be necessary , and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew , I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services . 
I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner , from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life . 
This , briefly , is his story . 
Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune , and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money , the father of the girl consented to the match . 
He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony ; but she was bathed in tears , and throwing herself at his feet , entreated him to spare her , confessing at the same time that she loved another , but that he was poor , and that her father would never consent to the union . 
My generous friend reassured the suppliant , and on being informed of the name of her lover , instantly abandoned his pursuit . 
He had already bought a farm with his money , on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life ; but he bestowed the whole on his rival , together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock , and then himself solicited the young woman 's father to consent to her marriage with her lover . 
But the old man decidedly refused , thinking himself bound in honour to my friend , who , when he found the father inexorable , quitted his country , nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations . 
` What a noble fellow ! ' 
you will exclaim . 
He is so ; but then he is wholly uneducated : he is as silent as a Turk , and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him , which , while it renders his conduct the more astonishing , detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command . 
Yet do not suppose , because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know , that I am wavering in my resolutions . 
Those are as fixed as fate , and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation . 
The winter has been dreadfully severe , but the spring promises well , and it is considered as a remarkably early season , so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected . 
I shall do nothing rashly : you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care . 
I can not describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking . 
It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation , half pleasurable and half fearful , with which I am preparing to depart . 
I am going to unexplored regions , to ` the land of mist and snow , ' but I shall kill no albatross ; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ` Ancient Mariner . ' 
You will smile at my allusion , but I will disclose a secret . 
I have often attributed my attachment to , my passionate enthusiasm for , the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets . 
There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand . 
I am practically industrious -- painstaking , a workman to execute with perseverance and labour -- but besides this there is a love for the marvellous , a belief in the marvellous , intertwined in all my projects , which hurries me out of the common pathways of men , even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore . 
But to return to dearer considerations . 
Shall I meet you again , after having traversed immense seas , and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America ? 
I dare not expect such success , yet I can not bear to look on the reverse of the picture . 
Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity : I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits . 
I love you very tenderly . 
Remember me with affection , should you never hear from me again . 
Your affectionate brother , Robert Walton Letter 3 July 7th , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England My dear Sister , I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe -- and well advanced on my voyage . 
This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel ; more fortunate than I , who may not see my native land , perhaps , for many years . 
I am , however , in good spirits : my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose , nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us , indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing , appear to dismay them . 
We have already reached a very high latitude ; but it is the height of summer , and although not so warm as in England , the southern gales , which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain , breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected . 
No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter . 
One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record , and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage . 
Adieu , my dear Margaret . 
Be assured that for my own sake , as well as yours , I will not rashly encounter danger . 
I will be cool , persevering , and prudent . 
But success SHALL crown my endeavours . 
Wherefore not ? 
Thus far I have gone , tracing a secure way over the pathless seas , the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph . 
Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element ? 
What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man ? 
My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus . 
But I must finish . 
Heaven bless my beloved sister ! 
R.W. Letter 4 August 5th , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England So strange an accident has happened to us that I can not forbear recording it , although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession . 
Last Monday -LRB- July 31st -RRB- we were nearly surrounded by ice , which closed in the ship on all sides , scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated . 
Our situation was somewhat dangerous , especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog . 
We accordingly lay to , hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather . 
About two o'clock the mist cleared away , and we beheld , stretched out in every direction , vast and irregular plains of ice , which seemed to have no end . 
Some of my comrades groaned , and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts , when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation . 
We perceived a low carriage , fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs , pass on towards the north , at the distance of half a mile ; a being which had the shape of a man , but apparently of gigantic stature , sat in the sledge and guided the dogs . 
We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice . 
This appearance excited our unqualified wonder . 
We were , as we believed , many hundred miles from any land ; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not , in reality , so distant as we had supposed . 
Shut in , however , by ice , it was impossible to follow his track , which we had observed with the greatest attention . 
About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea , and before night the ice broke and freed our ship . 
We , however , lay to until the morning , fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice . 
I profited of this time to rest for a few hours . 
In the morning , however , as soon as it was light , I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel , apparently talking to someone in the sea . 
It was , in fact , a sledge , like that we had seen before , which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice . 
Only one dog remained alive ; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel . 
He was not , as the other traveller seemed to be , a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island , but a European . 
When I appeared on deck the master said , ` Here is our captain , and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea . ' 
On perceiving me , the stranger addressed me in English , although with a foreign accent . 
` Before I come on board your vessel , ' said he , ` will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound ? ' 
You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford . 
I replied , however , that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole . 
Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board . 
Good God ! 
Margaret , if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety , your surprise would have been boundless . 
His limbs were nearly frozen , and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering . 
I never saw a man in so wretched a condition . 
We attempted to carry him into the cabin , but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted . 
We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity . 
As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove . 
By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup , which restored him wonderfully . 
Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak , and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding . 
When he had in some measure recovered , I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit . 
I never saw a more interesting creature : his eyes have generally an expression of wildness , and even madness , but there are moments when , if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service , his whole countenance is lighted up , as it were , with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled . 
But he is generally melancholy and despairing , and sometimes he gnashes his teeth , as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him . 
When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men , who wished to ask him a thousand questions ; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity , in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose . 
Once , however , the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle . 
His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom , and he replied , ` To seek one who fled from me . ' 
` And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
` Then I fancy we have seen him , for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge , with a man in it , across the ice . ' 
This aroused the stranger 's attention , and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon , as he called him , had pursued . 
Soon after , when he was alone with me , he said , ' I have , doubtless , excited your curiosity , as well as that of these good people ; but you are too considerate to make inquiries . ' 
` Certainly ; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine . ' 
` And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation ; you have benevolently restored me to life . ' 
Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge . 
I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty , for the ice had not broken until near midnight , and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time ; but of this I could not judge . 
From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger . 
He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared ; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin , for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere . 
I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight . 
Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day . 
The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin . 
Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him , although they have had very little communication with him . 
For my own part , I begin to love him as a brother , and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion . 
He must have been a noble creature in his better days , being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable . 
I said in one of my letters , my dear Margaret , that I should find no friend on the wide ocean ; yet I have found a man who , before his spirit had been broken by misery , I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart . 
I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals , should I have any fresh incidents to record . 
August 13th , 17 -- My affection for my guest increases every day . 
He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree . 
How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief ? 
He is so gentle , yet so wise ; his mind is so cultivated , and when he speaks , although his words are culled with the choicest art , yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence . 
He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck , apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own . 
Yet , although unhappy , he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others . 
He has frequently conversed with me on mine , which I have communicated to him without disguise . 
He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it . 
I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart , to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say , with all the fervour that warmed me , how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune , my existence , my every hope , to the furtherance of my enterprise . 
One man 's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought , for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race . 
As I spoke , a dark gloom spread over my listener 's countenance . 
At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion ; he placed his hands before his eyes , and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers ; a groan burst from his heaving breast . 
I paused ; at length he spoke , in broken accents : ` Unhappy man ! 
Do you share my madness ? 
Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught ? 
Hear me ; let me reveal my tale , and you will dash the cup from your lips ! ' 
Such words , you may imagine , strongly excited my curiosity ; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers , and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure . 
Having conquered the violence of his feelings , he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion ; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair , he led me again to converse concerning myself personally . 
He asked me the history of my earlier years . 
The tale was quickly told , but it awakened various trains of reflection . 
I spoke of my desire of finding a friend , of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot , and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing . ' 
I agree with you , ' replied the stranger ; ` we are unfashioned creatures , but half made up , if one wiser , better , dearer than ourselves -- such a friend ought to be -- do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures . 
I once had a friend , the most noble of human creatures , and am entitled , therefore , to judge respecting friendship . 
You have hope , and the world before you , and have no cause for despair . 
But I -- I have lost everything and can not begin life anew . ' 
As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm , settled grief that touched me to the heart . 
But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin . 
Even broken in spirit as he is , no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature . 
The starry sky , the sea , and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth . 
Such a man has a double existence : he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments , yet when he has retired into himself , he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him , within whose circle no grief or folly ventures . 
Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer ? 
You would not if you saw him . 
You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world , and you are therefore somewhat fastidious ; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man . 
Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew . 
I believe it to be an intuitive discernment , a quick but never-failing power of judgment , a penetration into the causes of things , unequalled for clearness and precision ; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music . 
August 19 , 17 -- Yesterday the stranger said to me , ` You may easily perceive , Captain Walton , that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes . 
I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me , but you have won me to alter my determination . 
You seek for knowledge and wisdom , as I once did ; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you , as mine has been . 
I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you ; yet , when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course , exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am , I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale , one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure . 
Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous . 
Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief , perhaps your ridicule ; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature ; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed . ' 
You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication , yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes . 
I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative , partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power . 
I expressed these feelings in my answer . ' 
I thank you , ' he replied , ` for your sympathy , but it is useless ; my fate is nearly fulfilled . 
I wait but for one event , and then I shall repose in peace . 
I understand your feeling , ' continued he , perceiving that I wished to interrupt him ; ` but you are mistaken , my friend , if thus you will allow me to name you ; nothing can alter my destiny ; listen to my history , and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined . ' 
He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure . 
This promise drew from me the warmest thanks . 
I have resolved every night , when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties , to record , as nearly as possible in his own words , what he has related during the day . 
If I should be engaged , I will at least make notes . 
This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure ; but to me , who know him , and who hear it from his own lips -- with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day ! 
Even now , as I commence my task , his full-toned voice swells in my ears ; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness ; I see his thin hand raised in animation , while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within . 
Strange and harrowing must be his story , frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it -- thus ! 
Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese , and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic . 
My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics , and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation . 
He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business . 
He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country ; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early , nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family . 
As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character , I can not refrain from relating them . 
One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who , from a flourishing state , fell , through numerous mischances , into poverty . 
This man , whose name was Beaufort , was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence . 
Having paid his debts , therefore , in the most honourable manner , he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne , where he lived unknown and in wretchedness . 
My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances . 
He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them . 
He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out , with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance . 
Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself , and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode . 
Overjoyed at this discovery , he hastened to the house , which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss . 
But when he entered , misery and despair alone welcomed him . 
Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes , but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months , and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant 's house . 
The interval was , consequently , spent in inaction ; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection , and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness , incapable of any exertion . 
His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness , but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support . 
But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould , and her courage rose to support her in her adversity . 
She procured plain work ; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life . 
Several months passed in this manner . 
Her father grew worse ; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him ; her means of subsistence decreased ; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms , leaving her an orphan and a beggar . 
This last blow overcame her , and she knelt by Beaufort 's coffin weeping bitterly , when my father entered the chamber . 
He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl , who committed herself to his care ; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation . 
Two years after this event Caroline became his wife . 
There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents , but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection . 
There was a sense of justice in my father 's upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly . 
Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth . 
There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother , differing wholly from the doting fondness of age , for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of , in some degree , recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured , but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her . 
Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience . 
He strove to shelter her , as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener , from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind . 
Her health , and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit , had been shaken by what she had gone through . 
During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions ; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy , and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders , as a restorative for her weakened frame . 
From Italy they visited Germany and France . 
I , their eldest child , was born at Naples , and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles . 
I remained for several years their only child . 
Much as they were attached to each other , they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me . 
My mother 's tender caresses and my father 's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections . 
I was their plaything and their idol , and something better -- their child , the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven , whom to bring up to good , and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery , according as they fulfilled their duties towards me . 
With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life , added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both , it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience , of charity , and of self-control , I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me . 
For a long time I was their only care . 
My mother had much desired to have a daughter , but I continued their single offspring . 
When I was about five years old , while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy , they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como . 
Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor . 
This , to my mother , was more than a duty ; it was a necessity , a passion -- remembering what she had suffered , and how she had been relieved -- for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted . 
During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate , while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape . 
One day , when my father had gone by himself to Milan , my mother , accompanied by me , visited this abode . 
She found a peasant and his wife , hard working , bent down by care and labour , distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes . 
Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest . 
She appeared of a different stock . 
The four others were dark-eyed , hardy little vagrants ; this child was thin and very fair . 
Her hair was the brightest living gold , and despite the poverty of her clothing , seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head . 
Her brow was clear and ample , her blue eyes cloudless , and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species , a being heaven-sent , and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features . 
The peasant woman , perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl , eagerly communicated her history . 
She was not her child , but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman . 
Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth . 
The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse : they were better off then . 
They had not been long married , and their eldest child was but just born . 
The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy -- one among the schiavi ognor frementi , who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country . 
He became the victim of its weakness . 
Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known . 
His property was confiscated ; his child became an orphan and a beggar . 
She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode , fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles . 
When my father returned from Milan , he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub -- a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills . 
The apparition was soon explained . 
With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her . 
They were fond of the sweet orphan . 
Her presence had seemed a blessing to them , but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection . 
They consulted their village priest , and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents ' house -- my more than sister -- the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures . 
Everyone loved Elizabeth . 
The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became , while I shared it , my pride and my delight . 
On the evening previous to her being brought to my home , my mother had said playfully , ' I have a pretty present for my Victor -- tomorrow he shall have it . ' 
And when , on the morrow , she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift , I , with childish seriousness , interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine -- mine to protect , love , and cherish . 
All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own . 
We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin . 
No word , no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me -- my more than sister , since till death she was to be mine only .
