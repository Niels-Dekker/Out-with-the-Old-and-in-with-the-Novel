|MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London , and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army . |	DEFAULT									
|Having completed my studies there , I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon . |	DEFAULT									
|The regiment was stationed in India at the time , and before I could join it , the second Afghan war had broken out . |	DEFAULT									
|On landing at Bombay , I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes , and was already deep in the enemy 's country . |	DEFAULT									
|I followed , however , with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself , and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety , where I found my regiment , and at once entered upon my new duties . |	DEFAULT									
|The campaign brought honours and promotion to many , but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster . |	DEFAULT									
|I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires , with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand . |	DEFAULT									
|There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet , which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery . |	DEFAULT									
|I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray , my orderly , who threw me across a pack-horse , and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines . |	DEFAULT	Murray								
|Worn with pain , and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone , I was removed , with a great train of wounded sufferers , to the base hospital at Peshawar . |	DEFAULT									
|Here I rallied , and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards , and even to bask a little upon the verandah , when I was struck down by enteric fever , that curse of our Indian possessions . |	DEFAULT									
|For months my life was despaired of , and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent , I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England . |	DEFAULT									
|I was dispatched , accordingly , in the troopship `` Orontes , '' and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty , with my health irretrievably ruined , but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it . |	DEFAULT									
|I had neither kith nor kin in England , and was therefore as free as air -- or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be . |	DEFAULT									
|Under such circumstances , I naturally gravitated to London , that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained . |	DEFAULT									
|There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand , leading a comfortless , meaningless existence , and spending such money as I had , considerably more freely than I ought . |	DEFAULT									
|So alarming did the state of my finances become , that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country , or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living . |	DEFAULT									
|Choosing the latter alternative , I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel , and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile . |	DEFAULT									
|On the very day that I had come to this conclusion , I was standing at the Criterion Bar , when some one tapped me on the shoulder , and turning round I recognized young Stamford , who had been a dresser under me at Barts . |	DEFAULT	Stamford								
|The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man . |										
|In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine , but now I hailed him with enthusiasm , and he , in his turn , appeared to be delighted to see me . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|In the exuberance of my joy , I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn , and we started off together in a hansom . |	Stamford	Dr. Watson								
|`` Whatever have you been doing with yourself , Watson ? '' |	Dr. Watson									
|he asked in undisguised wonder , as we rattled through the crowded London streets . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut . '' |	DEFAULT									
|I gave him a short sketch of my adventures , and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Poor devil ! '' |										
|he said , commiseratingly , after he had listened to my misfortunes . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` What are you up to now ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Looking for lodgings . '' |										
|-LSB- 3 -RSB- I answered . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price . '' |										
|`` That 's a strange thing , '' remarked my companion ; `` you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` And who was the first ? '' |										
|I asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital . |										
|He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found , and which were too much for his purse . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` By Jove ! '' |										
|I cried , `` if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense , I am the very man for him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I should prefer having a partner to being alone . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|`` You do n't know Sherlock Holmes yet , '' he said ; `` perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion . '' |	Stamford	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES	DEFAULT							
|`` Why , what is there against him ? '' |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|`` Oh , I did n't say there was anything against him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He is a little queer in his ideas -- an enthusiast in some branches of science . |	DEFAULT									
|As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` A medical student , I suppose ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|said I. `` No -- I have no idea what he intends to go in for . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I believe he is well up in anatomy , and he is a first-class chemist ; but , as far as I know , he has never taken out any systematic medical classes . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His studies are very desultory and eccentric , but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Did you never ask him what he was going in for ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` No ; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out , though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I should like to meet him , '' I said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` If I am to lodge with anyone , I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits . |	DEFAULT									
|I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement . |	DEFAULT									
|I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence . |	DEFAULT									
|How could I meet this friend of yours ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` He is sure to be at the laboratory , '' returned my companion . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` He either avoids the place for weeks , or else he works there from morning to night . |	DEFAULT									
|If you like , we shall drive round together after luncheon . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Certainly , '' I answered , and the conversation drifted away into other channels . |	DEFAULT									
|As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn , Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|`` You must n't blame me if you do n't get on with him , '' he said ; `` I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory . |	Stamford	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|You proposed this arrangement , so you must not hold me responsible . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` If we do n't get on it will be easy to part company , '' I answered . |	DEFAULT									
|`` It seems to me , Stamford , '' I added , looking hard at my companion , `` that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|Is this fellow 's temper so formidable , or what is it ? |										
|Do n't be mealy-mouthed about it . '' |										
|`` It is not easy to express the inexpressible , '' he answered with a laugh . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes -- it approaches to cold-bloodedness . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES	DEFAULT								
|I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid , not out of malevolence , you understand , but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects . |	DEFAULT	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES								
|To do him justice , I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Very right too . '' |										
|`` Yes , but it may be pushed to excess . |										
|When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick , it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape . '' |										
|`` Beating the subjects ! '' |										
|`` Yes , to verify how far bruises may be produced after death . |										
|I saw him at it with my own eyes . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` And yet you say he is not a medical student ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` No . |										
|Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are . |	DEFAULT									
|But here we are , and you must form your own impressions about him . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|As he spoke , we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door , which opened into a wing of the great hospital . |	DEFAULT									
|It was familiar ground to me , and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors . |	DEFAULT									
|Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory . |										
|This was a lofty chamber , lined and littered with countless bottles . |										
|Broad , low tables were scattered about , which bristled with retorts , test-tubes , and little Bunsen lamps , with their blue flickering flames . |										
|There was only one student in the room , who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work . |	DEFAULT									
|At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I 've found it ! |	DEFAULT									
|I 've found it , '' he shouted to my companion , running towards us with a test-tube in his hand . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin , -LSB- 4 -RSB- and by nothing else . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Had he discovered a gold mine , greater delight could not have shone upon his features . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|`` Dr. Watson , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' said Stamford , introducing us . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES	Dr. Watson	Stamford							
|`` How are you ? '' |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|he said cordially , gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` You have been in Afghanistan , I perceive . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` How on earth did you know that ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|I asked in astonishment . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Never mind , '' said he , chuckling to himself . |	DEFAULT									
|`` The question now is about hoemoglobin . |										
|No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` It is interesting , chemically , no doubt , '' I answered , `` but practically -- '' `` Why , man , it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years . |	DEFAULT									
|Do n't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains . |	DEFAULT									
|Come over here now ! '' |										
|He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness , and drew me over to the table at which he had been working . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Let us have some fresh blood , '' he said , digging a long bodkin into his finger , and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Now , I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water . |	DEFAULT									
|You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water . |	DEFAULT									
|The proportion of blood can not be more than one in a million . |										
|I have no doubt , however , that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction . '' |	DEFAULT									
|As he spoke , he threw into the vessel a few white crystals , and then added some drops of a transparent fluid . |	DEFAULT									
|In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour , and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar . |										
|`` Ha ! |										
|ha ! '' |										
|he cried , clapping his hands , and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy . |	DEFAULT									
|`` What do you think of that ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` It seems to be a very delicate test , '' I remarked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Beautiful ! |										
|beautiful ! |										
|The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain . |										
|So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles . |										
|The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old . |										
|Now , this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new . |										
|Had this test been invented , there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes . '' |										
|`` Indeed ! '' |										
|I murmured . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point . |										
|A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed . |										
|His linen or clothes are examined , and brownish stains discovered upon them . |	DEFAULT									
|Are they blood stains , or mud stains , or rust stains , or fruit stains , or what are they ? |										
|That is a question which has puzzled many an expert , and why ? |										
|Because there was no reliable test . |										
|Now we have the Sherlock Holmes ' test , and there will no longer be any difficulty . '' |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke , and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|`` You are to be congratulated , '' I remarked , considerably surprised at his enthusiasm . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year . |	Von Bischoff									
|He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence . |	DEFAULT									
|Then there was Mason of Bradford , and the notorious Muller , and Lefevre of Montpellier , and Samson of New Orleans . |										
|I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` You seem to be a walking calendar of crime , '' said Stamford with a laugh . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|`` You might start a paper on those lines . |	DEFAULT									
|Call it the ` Police News of the Past . |										
|''' `` Very interesting reading it might be made , too , '' remarked Sherlock Holmes , sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|`` I have to be careful , '' he continued , turning to me with a smile , `` for I dabble with poisons a good deal . '' |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES	DEFAULT								
|He held out his hand as he spoke , and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster , and discoloured with strong acids . |	DEFAULT									
|`` We came here on business , '' said Stamford , sitting down on a high three-legged stool , and pushing another one in my direction with his foot . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|`` My friend here wants to take diggings , and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you , I thought that I had better bring you together . '' |	Stamford	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES								
|Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES	DEFAULT								
|`` I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street , '' he said , `` which would suit us down to the ground . |	MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES									
|You do n't mind the smell of strong tobacco , I hope ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I always smoke ` ship 's ' myself , '' I answered . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` That 's good enough . |										
|I generally have chemicals about , and occasionally do experiments . |	DEFAULT									
|Would that annoy you ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` By no means . '' |										
|`` Let me see -- what are my other shortcomings . |	DEFAULT									
|I get in the dumps at times , and do n't open my mouth for days on end . |	DEFAULT									
|You must not think I am sulky when I do that . |	DEFAULT									
|Just let me alone , and I 'll soon be right . |	DEFAULT									
|What have you to confess now ? |	DEFAULT									
|It 's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together . '' |										
|I laughed at this cross-examination . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I keep a bull pup , '' I said , `` and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken , and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours , and I am extremely lazy . |	DEFAULT									
|I have another set of vices when I 'm well , but those are the principal ones at present . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|he asked , anxiously . |	DEFAULT									
|`` It depends on the player , '' I answered . |	DEFAULT									
|`` A well-played violin is a treat for the gods -- a badly-played one -- '' `` Oh , that 's all right , '' he cried , with a merry laugh . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I think we may consider the thing as settled -- that is , if the rooms are agreeable to you . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` When shall we see them ? '' |										
|`` Call for me here at noon to-morrow , and we 'll go together and settle everything , '' he answered . |	DEFAULT									
|`` All right -- noon exactly , '' said I , shaking his hand . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|We left him working among his chemicals , and we walked together towards my hotel . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` By the way , '' I asked suddenly , stopping and turning upon Stamford , `` how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan ? '' |	Stamford	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|My companion smiled an enigmatical smile . |	DEFAULT									
|`` That 's just his little peculiarity , '' he said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Oh ! |										
|a mystery is it ? '' |										
|I cried , rubbing my hands . |	DEFAULT									
|`` This is very piquant . |										
|I am much obliged to you for bringing us together . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` The proper study of mankind is man , ' you know . '' |	Stamford									
|`` You must study him , then , '' Stamford said , as he bade me good-bye . |	Stamford	DEFAULT								
|`` You 'll find him a knotty problem , though . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I 'll wager he learns more about you than you about him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|Good-bye . '' |										
|`` Good-bye , '' I answered , and strolled on to my hotel , considerably interested in my new acquaintance . |	DEFAULT
