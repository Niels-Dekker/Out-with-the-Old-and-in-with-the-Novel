0.838172814361894	75	|With the next he was more successful . |	|He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen . |	|From the table drawer he took out a penholder , a bottle of ink , and a thick , quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover . |	1	DEFAULT

0.496937590691076	19	|His hair was very fair , his face naturally sanguine , his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended . |	|Outside , even through the shut window-pane , the world looked cold . |	|Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals , and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue , there seemed to be no colour in anything , except the posters that were plastered everywhere . |	0										
0.968439989111811	86	|Its smooth creamy paper , a little yellowed by age , was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past . |	|He could guess , however , that the book was much older than that . |	|He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town -LRB- just what quarter he did not now remember -RRB- and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it . |	1	DEFAULT

0.042551434325557	126	|Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic , only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down . |	|His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page , shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops : April 4th , 1984 . |	|Last night to the flicks . |	1	DEFAULT

0.016149927521168	190	|Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it , and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people , less level-headed than oneself , might be taken in by it . |	|He was abusing Big Brother , he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party , he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia , he was advocating freedom of speech , freedom of the Press , freedom of assembly , freedom of thought , he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed -- and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party , and even contained Newspeak words : more Newspeak words , indeed , than any Party member would normally use in real life . |	|And all the while , lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein 's specious claptrap covered , behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army -- row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces , who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished , to be replaced by others exactly similar . |	2	Emmanuel Goldstein	Big Brother								
0.258251317345605	1	|Chapter 1 It was a bright cold day in April , and the clocks were striking thirteen . |	|Winston Smith , his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind , slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions , though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him . |	|The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.588007619411342	50	|From where Winston stood it was just possible to read , picked out on its white face in elegant lettering , the three slogans of the Party : WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH The Ministry of Truth contained , it was said , three thousand rooms above ground level , and corresponding ramifications below . |	|Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size . |	|So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously . |	0										
0.281475196067783	208	|People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen . |	|The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink , and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish . |	|Even O'Brien 's heavy face was flushed . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.306955756054829	170	|Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess : indeed , there was no way of doing so . |	|At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch , saw that it was nearly eleven hundred , and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over . |	|He took a chair in the same row as Winston , a couple of places away . |	1	O'Brien									
0.069450832316811	227	|Vivid , beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind . |	|He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon . |	|He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.279027434328794	69	|It gave off a sickly , oily smell , as of Chinese rice-spirit . |	|Winston poured out nearly a teacupful , nerved himself for a shock , and gulped it down like a dose of medicine . |	|Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.378206412417345	152	|It was always the women , and above all the young ones , who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party , the swallowers of slogans , the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy . |	|But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most . |	|Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.383820382736544	160	|O'Brien was a large , burly man with a thick neck and a coarse , humorous , brutal face . |	|In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner . |	|He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming -- in some indefinable way , curiously civilized . |	1	O'Brien									
0.588293266166983	193	|The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers ' boots formed the background to Goldstein 's bleating voice . |	|Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds , uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room . |	|The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen , and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it , were too much to be borne : besides , the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically . |	0										
0.602079008158475	197	|But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody , although every day and a thousand times a day , on platforms , on the telescreen , in newspapers , in books , his theories were refuted , smashed , ridiculed , held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were -- in spite of all this , his influence never seemed to grow less . |	|Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him . |	|A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police . |	1	Emmanuel Goldstein									
0.348383953658845	21	|Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals , and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue , there seemed to be no colour in anything , except the posters that were plastered everywhere . |	|The black-moustachio 'd face gazed down from every commanding corner . |	|There was one on the house-front immediately opposite . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.499294405405907	114	|Either the future would resemble the present , in which case it would not listen to him : or it would be different from it , and his predicament would be meaningless . |	|For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper . |	|The telescreen had changed over to strident military music . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.989301231433533	238	|It was merely a few words of encouragement , the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle , not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken . |	|Then the face of Big Brother faded away again , and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals : WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen , as though the impact that it had made on everyone 's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately . |	|The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her . |	1	Big Brother									
0.653214983310811	314	|The worst thing of all would be to delay . |	|His heart was thumping like a drum , but his face , from long habit , was probably expressionless . |	|He got up and moved heavily towards the door . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.570785131396939	171	|At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch , saw that it was nearly eleven hundred , and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over . |	|He took a chair in the same row as Winston , a couple of places away . |	|A small , sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them . |	2	Winston Smith	O'Brien								
0.561930489302628	151	|He disliked nearly all women , and especially the young and pretty ones . |	|It was always the women , and above all the young ones , who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party , the swallowers of slogans , the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy . |	|But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most . |	0										
0.914401418447133	80	|To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting , and which , when the flats were built , had probably been intended to hold bookshelves . |	|By sitting in the alcove , and keeping well back , Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen , so far as sight went . |	|He could be heard , of course , but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.204575289510282	46	|The Ministry of Truth -- Minitrue , in Newspeak -LSB- Newspeak was the official language of Oceania . |	|For an account of its structure and etymology see Appendix . -RSB- |	|-- was startlingly different from any other object in sight . |	0										
0.795776932993396	180	|The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust . |	|Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once , long ago -LRB- how long ago , nobody quite remembered -RRB- , had been one of the leading figures of the Party , almost on a level with Big Brother himself , and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities , had been condemned to death , and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared . |	|The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day , but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure . |	2	Emmanuel Goldstein	Big Brother								
0.110034648105555	284	|Winston roused himself and sat up straighter . |	|He let out a belch . |	|The gin was rising from his stomach . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.396022806850237	244	|It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer . |	|At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep , slow , rhythmical chant of ` B-B ! |	|... B-B ! ' |	0										
0.206273912295795	236	|But in the same moment , drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody , the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother , black-haired , black-moustachio 'd , full of power and mysterious calm , and so vast that it almost filled up the screen . |	|Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying . |	|It was merely a few words of encouragement , the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle , not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken . |	1	Big Brother									
0.322252109677815	99	|Apart from very short notes , it was usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present purpose . |	|He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second . |	|A tremor had gone through his bowels . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.333678037984347	67	|By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen , and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow 's breakfast . |	|He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN . |	|It gave off a sickly , oily smell , as of Chinese rice-spirit . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.189998983183509	60	|There were no windows in it at all . |	|Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love , nor within half a kilometre of it . |	|It was a place impossible to enter except on official business , and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements , steel doors , and hidden machine-gun nests . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.704613219585021	56	|The Ministry of Love , which maintained law and order . |	|And the Ministry of Plenty , which was responsible for economic affairs . |	|Their names , in Newspeak : Minitrue , Minipax , Miniluv , and Miniplenty . |	0										
0.243783094842454	304	|People simply disappeared , always during the night . |	|Your name was removed from the registers , every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out , your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten . |	|You were abolished , annihilated : VAPORIZED was the usual word . |	0										
0.627291879783301	7	|It was no use trying the lift . |	|Even at the best of times it was seldom working , and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours . |	|It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week . |	0										
0.661880827148452	266	|I am with you , ' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him . ' |	|I know precisely what you are feeling . |	|I know all about your contempt , your hatred , your disgust . |	1	O'Brien									
0.065686733237255	186	|Winston 's diaphragm was constricted . |	|He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions . |	|It was a lean Jewish face , with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard -- a clever face , and yet somehow inherently despicable , with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose , near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched . |	2	Winston Smith	Emmanuel Goldstein								
0.148111136175865	249	|It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion . |	|Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother , but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis , a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise . |	|Winston 's entrails seemed to grow cold . |	1	Big Brother									
0.385706475921545	245	|At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep , slow , rhythmical chant of ` B-B ! |	|... B-B ! ' |	|-- over and over again , very slowly , with a long pause between the first ` B ' and the second -- a heavy , murmurous sound , somehow curiously savage , in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms . |	0										
0.848126836022464	82	|He could be heard , of course , but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen . |	|It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do . |	|But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.303970652622594	140	|It had happened that morning at the Ministry , if anything so nebulous could be said to happen . |	|It was nearly eleven hundred , and in the Records Department , where Winston worked , they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen , in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate . |	|Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight , but had never spoken to , came unexpectedly into the room . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.840959876989352	189	|It resembled the face of a sheep , and the voice , too , had a sheep-like quality . |	|Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it , and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people , less level-headed than oneself , might be taken in by it . |	|He was abusing Big Brother , he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party , he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia , he was advocating freedom of speech , freedom of the Press , freedom of assembly , freedom of thought , he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed -- and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party , and even contained Newspeak words : more Newspeak words , indeed , than any Party member would normally use in real life . |	1	Emmanuel Goldstein									
0.514222088251452	178	|As usual , the face of Emmanuel Goldstein , the Enemy of the People , had flashed on to the screen . |	|There were hisses here and there among the audience . |	|The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust . |	0										
0.500242415462553	2	|Winston Smith , his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind , slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions , though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him . |	|The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats . |	|At one end of it a coloured poster , too large for indoor display , had been tacked to the wall . |	0										
0.415200680001872	130	|One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean . |	|Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him , first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise , then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights , then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water , audience shouting with laughter when he sank . |	|then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.836297157504652	155	|The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police . |	|That , it was true , was very unlikely . |	|Still , he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness , which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility , whenever she was anywhere near him . |	0										
0.451158150322224	212	|The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out ` Swine ! |	|Swine ! |	|Swine ! ' |	0										
0.511540901532687	9	|It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week . |	|The flat was seven flights up , and Winston , who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle , went slowly , resting several times on the way . |	|On each landing , opposite the lift-shaft , the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.686770913776598	167	|Something in his face suggested it irresistibly . |	|And again , perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face , but simply intelligence . |	|But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.081559923926659	214	|Swine ! ' |	|and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen . |	|It struck Goldstein 's nose and bounced off ; the voice continued inexorably . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.000409850514803	64	|Winston turned round abruptly . |	|He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen . |	|He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen . |	1	Winston Smith									
0.739188014124091	272	|Such incidents never had any sequel . |	|All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief , or hope , that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party . |	|Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all -- perhaps the Brotherhood really existed ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.628628589885697	290	|His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper , printing in large neat capitals -- DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER over and over again , filling half a page . |	|He could not help feeling a twinge of panic . |	|It was absurd , since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary , but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.086931409994297	210	|Even O'Brien 's heavy face was flushed . |	|He was sitting very straight in his chair , his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave . |	|The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out ` Swine ! |	1	O'Brien									
0.163013487186621	94	|The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary . |	|This was not illegal -LRB- nothing was illegal , since there were no longer any laws -RRB- , but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death , or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp . |	|Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off . |	0										
0.436756135050588	259	|Momentarily he caught O'Brien 's eye . |	|O'Brien had stood up . |	|He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture . |	1	O'Brien									
0.628325289375547	76	|He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen . |	|From the table drawer he took out a penholder , a bottle of ink , and a thick , quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover . |	|For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position . |	0										
0.363665398088739	138	|But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind , to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down . |	|It was , he now realized , because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today . |	|It had happened that morning at the Ministry , if anything so nebulous could be said to happen . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.03377640459872	206	|Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it . |	|In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy . |	|People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen . |	0										
0.649683961503158	84	|But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer . |	|It was a peculiarly beautiful book . |	|Its smooth creamy paper , a little yellowed by age , was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past . |	0										
0.359130094007101	118	|For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment , and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage . |	|The actual writing would be easy . |	|All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head , literally for years . |	0										
0.161623770356829	297	|He had committed -- would still have committed , even if he had never set pen to paper -- the essential crime that contained all others in itself . |	|Thoughtcrime , they called it . |	|Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever . |	0										
0.525700591661002	299	|Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever . |	|You might dodge successfully for a while , even for years , but sooner or later they were bound to get you . |	|It was always at night -- the arrests invariably happened at night . |	0										
0.997755304334885	113	|It was of its nature impossible . |	|Either the future would resemble the present , in which case it would not listen to him : or it would be different from it , and his predicament would be meaningless . |	|For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.151320613209498	122	|Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably . |	|He dared not scratch it , because if he did so it always became inflamed . |	|The seconds were ticking by . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.490383101208576	229	|He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian . |	|He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax . |	|Better than before , moreover , he realized WHY it was that he hated her . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.471599496255095	24	|BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU , the caption said , while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston 's own . |	|Down at street level another poster , torn at one corner , flapped fitfully in the wind , alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC . |	|In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs , hovered for an instant like a bluebottle , and darted away again with a curving flight . |	0
