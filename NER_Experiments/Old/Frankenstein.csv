0.709202178208725	169	|He must have been a noble creature in his better days , being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable . |	|I said in one of my letters , my dear Margaret , that I should find no friend on the wide ocean ; yet I have found a man who , before his spirit had been broken by misery , I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart . |	|I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals , should I have any fresh incidents to record . |	2	DEFAULT	Margaret								
0.897833939663245	163	|He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared ; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin , for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere . |	|I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight . |	|Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.6546849813079	196	|But I -- I have lost everything and can not begin life anew . ' |	|As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm , settled grief that touched me to the heart . |	|But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT

0.467347783362934	299	|We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin . |	|No word , no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me -- my more than sister , since till death she was to be mine only . |	|Chapter 2 We were brought up together ; there was not quite a year difference in our ages . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.099815292777766	44	|If I succeed , many , many months , perhaps years , will pass before you and I may meet . |	|If I fail , you will see me again soon , or never . |	|Farewell , my dear , excellent Margaret . |	2	DEFAULT	Margaret								
0.64976693181948	73	|He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony ; but she was bathed in tears , and throwing herself at his feet , entreated him to spare her , confessing at the same time that she loved another , but that he was poor , and that her father would never consent to the union . |	|My generous friend reassured the suppliant , and on being informed of the name of her lover , instantly abandoned his pursuit . |	|He had already bought a farm with his money , on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life ; but he bestowed the whole on his rival , together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock , and then himself solicited the young woman 's father to consent to her marriage with her lover . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.639971928308829	183	|At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion ; he placed his hands before his eyes , and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers ; a groan burst from his heaving breast . |	|I paused ; at length he spoke , in broken accents : ` Unhappy man ! |	|Do you share my madness ? |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.970754581213858	238	|Overjoyed at this discovery , he hastened to the house , which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss . |	|But when he entered , misery and despair alone welcomed him . |	|Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes , but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months , and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant 's house . |	1	Mr. Beaufort									
0.95057069197818	217	|I wait but for one event , and then I shall repose in peace . |	|I understand your feeling , ' continued he , perceiving that I wished to interrupt him ; ` but you are mistaken , my friend , if thus you will allow me to name you ; nothing can alter my destiny ; listen to my history , and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined . ' |	|He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.733133470359955	263	|I was their plaything and their idol , and something better -- their child , the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven , whom to bring up to good , and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery , according as they fulfilled their duties towards me . |	|With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life , added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both , it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience , of charity , and of self-control , I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me . |	|For a long time I was their only care . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.610838997422961	219	|He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure . |	|This promise drew from me the warmest thanks . |	|I have resolved every night , when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties , to record , as nearly as possible in his own words , what he has related during the day . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.712763159149507	190	|He asked me the history of my earlier years . |	|The tale was quickly told , but it awakened various trains of reflection . |	|I spoke of my desire of finding a friend , of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot , and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing . ' |	0										
0.270893947934817	14	|These are my enticements , and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat , with his holiday mates , on an expedition of discovery up his native river . |	|But supposing all these conjectures to be false , you can not contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind , to the last generation , by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries , to reach which at present so many months are requisite ; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet , which , if at all possible , can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine . |	|These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter , and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven , for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose -- a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.527838119889642	11	|What may not be expected in a country of eternal light ? |	|I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever . |	|I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited , and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.572948494001969	18	|I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole . |	|You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas ' library . |	|My education was neglected , yet I was passionately fond of reading . |	2	DEFAULT	Thomas								
0.925006601303543	8	|There , Margaret , the sun is forever visible , its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour . |	|There -- for with your leave , my sister , I will put some trust in preceding navigators -- there snow and frost are banished ; and , sailing over a calm sea , we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe . |	|Its productions and features may be without example , as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes . |	2	Margaret	DEFAULT								
0.724310512134728	221	|I have resolved every night , when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties , to record , as nearly as possible in his own words , what he has related during the day . |	|If I should be engaged , I will at least make notes . |	|This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure ; but to me , who know him , and who hear it from his own lips -- with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.538319439033097	47	|Heaven shower down blessings on you , and save me , that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness . |	|Your affectionate brother , R. Walton Letter 2 Archangel , 28th March , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England How slowly the time passes here , encompassed as I am by frost and snow ! |	|Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise . |	2	Walton	Mrs. Saville								
0.851907477161641	127	|I profited of this time to rest for a few hours . |	|In the morning , however , as soon as it was light , I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel , apparently talking to someone in the sea . |	|It was , in fact , a sledge , like that we had seen before , which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.491232088579073	252	|Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth . |	|There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother , differing wholly from the doting fondness of age , for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of , in some degree , recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured , but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her . |	|Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.770219343419658	149	|But he is generally melancholy and despairing , and sometimes he gnashes his teeth , as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him . |	|When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men , who wished to ask him a thousand questions ; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity , in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose . |	|Once , however , the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.659365185834524	65	|He is an Englishman , and in the midst of national and professional prejudices , unsoftened by cultivation , retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity . |	|I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel ; finding that he was unemployed in this city , I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise . |	|The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.125522850288316	7	|I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation ; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight . |	|There , Margaret , the sun is forever visible , its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour . |	|There -- for with your leave , my sister , I will put some trust in preceding navigators -- there snow and frost are banished ; and , sailing over a calm sea , we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe . |	1	Margaret									
0.391347959498476	222	|If I should be engaged , I will at least make notes . |	|This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure ; but to me , who know him , and who hear it from his own lips -- with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day ! |	|Even now , as I commence my task , his full-toned voice swells in my ears ; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness ; I see his thin hand raised in animation , while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within . |	3	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
0.165344190710275	114	|R.W. Letter 4 August 5th , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England So strange an accident has happened to us that I can not forbear recording it , although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession . |	|Last Monday -LRB- July 31st -RRB- we were nearly surrounded by ice , which closed in the ship on all sides , scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated . |	|Our situation was somewhat dangerous , especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog . |	0										
0.530365798606222	224	|Even now , as I commence my task , his full-toned voice swells in my ears ; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness ; I see his thin hand raised in animation , while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within . |	|Strange and harrowing must be his story , frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it -- thus ! |	|Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese , and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.215998059547298	134	|` Before I come on board your vessel , ' said he , ` will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound ? ' |	|You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford . |	|I replied , however , that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole . |	3	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
0.534223258887355	21	|These volumes were my study day and night , and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt , as a child , on learning that my father 's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life . |	|These visions faded when I perused , for the first time , those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven . |	|I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation ; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.72165760796045	128	|In the morning , however , as soon as it was light , I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel , apparently talking to someone in the sea . |	|It was , in fact , a sledge , like that we had seen before , which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice . |	|Only one dog remained alive ; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel . |	0										
0.44952708698594	144	|As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove . |	|By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup , which restored him wonderfully . |	|Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak , and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.199520550539338	120	|We perceived a low carriage , fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs , pass on towards the north , at the distance of half a mile ; a being which had the shape of a man , but apparently of gigantic stature , sat in the sledge and guided the dogs . |	|We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice . |	|This appearance excited our unqualified wonder . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.548475550615332	16	|These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter , and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven , for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose -- a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye . |	|This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years . |	|I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.71751744093954	187	|Hear me ; let me reveal my tale , and you will dash the cup from your lips ! ' |	|Such words , you may imagine , strongly excited my curiosity ; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers , and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure . |	|Having conquered the violence of his feelings , he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion ; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair , he led me again to converse concerning myself personally . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.791992385409896	143	|We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity . |	|As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove . |	|By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup , which restored him wonderfully . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.60458374812104	107	|Wherefore not ? |	|Thus far I have gone , tracing a secure way over the pathless seas , the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph . |	|Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element ? |	1	DEFAULT									
0.327419844241136	141	|I never saw a man in so wretched a condition . |	|We attempted to carry him into the cabin , but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted . |	|We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.486154462089027	85	|It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation , half pleasurable and half fearful , with which I am preparing to depart . |	|I am going to unexplored regions , to ` the land of mist and snow , ' but I shall kill no albatross ; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ` Ancient Mariner .

0.367503876060889	158	|` Certainly ; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine . ' |	|` And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation ; you have benevolently restored me to life . ' |	|Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.118175119924054	84	|I can not describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking . |	|It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation , half pleasurable and half fearful , with which I am preparing to depart . |	|I am going to unexplored regions , to ` the land of mist and snow , ' but I shall kill no albatross ; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ` Ancient Mariner .

0.330849700001196	4	|Do you understand this feeling ? |	|This breeze , which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing , gives me a foretaste of those icy climes . |	|Inspirited by this wind of promise , my daydreams become more fervent and vivid . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.148866256134067	80	|Yet do not suppose , because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know , that I am wavering in my resolutions . |	|Those are as fixed as fate , and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation . |	|The winter has been dreadfully severe , but the spring promises well , and it is considered as a remarkably early season , so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.866018600059407	176	|He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck , apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own . |	|Yet , although unhappy , he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others . |	|He has frequently conversed with me on mine , which I have communicated to him without disguise . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.302437307055844	39	|The cold is not excessive , if you are wrapped in furs -- a dress which I have already adopted , for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours , when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins . |	|I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel . |	|I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks ; and my intention is to hire a ship there , which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner , and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.973331372750057	277	|Her brow was clear and ample , her blue eyes cloudless , and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species , a being heaven-sent , and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features . |	|The peasant woman , perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl , eagerly communicated her history . |	|She was not her child , but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.832920360368917	19	|You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas ' library . |	|My education was neglected , yet I was passionately fond of reading . |	|These volumes were my study day and night , and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt , as a child , on learning that my father 's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.712903546566756	254	|Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience . |	|He strove to shelter her , as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener , from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind . |	|Her health , and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit , had been shaken by what she had gone through . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.407145881333559	38	|They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges ; the motion is pleasant , and , in my opinion , far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach . |	|The cold is not excessive , if you are wrapped in furs -- a dress which I have already adopted , for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours , when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins . |	|I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.911401296108259	226	|Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese , and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic . |	|My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics , and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation . |	|He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business . |	1	DEFAULT

0.931406064675473	87	|You will smile at my allusion , but I will disclose a secret . |	|I have often attributed my attachment to , my passionate enthusiasm for , the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets . |	|There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.134276515897525	213	|You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication , yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes . |	|I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative , partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power . |	|I expressed these feelings in my answer . ' |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.342939687501278	234	|My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances . |	|He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them . |	|He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out , with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.961347242375491	279	|She was not her child , but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman . |	|Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth . |	|The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse : they were better off then . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.920168288684853	273	|Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest . |	|She appeared of a different stock . |	|The four others were dark-eyed , hardy little vagrants ; this child was thin and very fair . |	1	DEFAULT

0.036835139337948	49	|Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise . |	|I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors ; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage . |	|But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy , and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil , I have no friend , Margaret : when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success , there will be none to participate my joy ; if I am assailed by disappointment , no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.240909543699851	62	|Well , these are useless complaints ; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean , nor even here in Archangel , among merchants and seamen . |	|Yet some feelings , unallied to the dross of human nature , beat even in these rugged bosoms . |	|My lieutenant , for instance , is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise ; he is madly desirous of glory , or rather , to word my phrase more characteristically , of advancement in his profession . |	0										
0.938149863884798	131	|He was not , as the other traveller seemed to be , a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island , but a European . |	|When I appeared on deck the master said , ` Here is our captain , and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea .

0.200841472328119	104	|Be assured that for my own sake , as well as yours , I will not rashly encounter danger . |	|I will be cool , persevering , and prudent . |	|But success SHALL crown my endeavours . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.222344164903368	115	|Last Monday -LRB- July 31st -RRB- we were nearly surrounded by ice , which closed in the ship on all sides , scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated . |	|Our situation was somewhat dangerous , especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog . |	|We accordingly lay to , hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather . |	0										
0.342681631421729	156	|This aroused the stranger 's attention , and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon , as he called him , had pursued . |	|Soon after , when he was alone with me , he said , ' I have , doubtless , excited your curiosity , as well as that of these good people ; but you are too considerate to make inquiries .

0.560520980147687	146	|Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak , and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding . |	|When he had in some measure recovered , I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit . |	|I never saw a more interesting creature : his eyes have generally an expression of wildness , and even madness , but there are moments when , if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service , his whole countenance is lighted up , as it were , with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT

0.705963227250781	46	|Farewell , my dear , excellent Margaret . |	|Heaven shower down blessings on you , and save me , that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness . |	|Your affectionate brother , R. Walton Letter 2 Archangel , 28th March , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England How slowly the time passes here , encompassed as I am by frost and snow ! |	2	Margaret	Walton								
0.633491580981986	215	|I expressed these feelings in my answer . ' |	|I thank you , ' he replied , ` for your sympathy , but it is useless ; my fate is nearly fulfilled . |	|I wait but for one event , and then I shall repose in peace . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.38251071960556	150	|When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men , who wished to ask him a thousand questions ; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity , in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose . |	|Once , however , the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle . |	|His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom , and he replied , ` To seek one who fled from me . ' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.582806876054173	285	|Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known . |	|His property was confiscated ; his child became an orphan and a beggar . |	|She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode , fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.473774631517398	188	|Such words , you may imagine , strongly excited my curiosity ; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers , and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure . |	|Having conquered the violence of his feelings , he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion ; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair , he led me again to converse concerning myself personally . |	|He asked me the history of my earlier years . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.641333224096592	77	|` What a noble fellow ! ' |	|you will exclaim . |	|He is so ; but then he is wholly uneducated : he is as silent as a Turk , and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him , which , while it renders his conduct the more astonishing , detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.19602893383329	260	|I remained for several years their only child . |	|Much as they were attached to each other , they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me . |	|My mother 's tender caresses and my father 's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.881882048003612	145	|By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup , which restored him wonderfully . |	|Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak , and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding . |	|When he had in some measure recovered , I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.804980453748686	258	|From Italy they visited Germany and France . |	|I , their eldest child , was born at Naples , and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles . |	|I remained for several years their only child . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.72631761969424	22	|These visions faded when I perused , for the first time , those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven . |	|I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation ; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated . |	|You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.893881818359883	269	|This , to my mother , was more than a duty ; it was a necessity , a passion -- remembering what she had suffered , and how she had been relieved -- for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted . |	|During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate , while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape . |	|One day , when my father had gone by himself to Milan , my mother , accompanied by me , visited this abode . |	0										
0.429795663200084	265	|For a long time I was their only care . |	|My mother had much desired to have a daughter , but I continued their single offspring . |	|When I was about five years old , while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy , they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.496274222235895	153	|` And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion ? ' |	|` Yes . ' |	|` Then I fancy we have seen him , for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge , with a man in it , across the ice . ' |	0										
0.237967731932663	256	|Her health , and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit , had been shaken by what she had gone through . |	|During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions ; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy , and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders , as a restorative for her weakened frame . |	|From Italy they visited Germany and France . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.594998320030543	122	|This appearance excited our unqualified wonder . |	|We were , as we believed , many hundred miles from any land ; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not , in reality , so distant as we had supposed . |	|Shut in , however , by ice , it was impossible to follow his track , which we had observed with the greatest attention . |	0										
0.924499909989888	294	|Everyone loved Elizabeth . |	|The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became , while I shared it , my pride and my delight . |	|On the evening previous to her being brought to my home , my mother had said playfully , ' I have a pretty present for my Victor -- tomorrow he shall have it . ' |	2	Elizabeth Lavenza	Victor								
0.756525299522518	251	|There was a sense of justice in my father 's upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly . |	|Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth . |	|There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother , differing wholly from the doting fondness of age , for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of , in some degree , recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured , but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.856730198806454	235	|He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them . |	|He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out , with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance . |	|Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself , and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode . |	1	Mr. Beaufort									
0.02759129015288	171	|I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals , should I have any fresh incidents to record . |	|August 13th , 17 -- My affection for my guest increases every day . |	|He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.405030711689137	155	|` Then I fancy we have seen him , for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge , with a man in it , across the ice . ' |	|This aroused the stranger 's attention , and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon , as he called him , had pursued . |	|Soon after , when he was alone with me , he said , ' I have , doubtless , excited your curiosity , as well as that of these good people ; but you are too considerate to make inquiries .

0.383831357138741	31	|I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness , so valuable did he consider my services . |	|And now , dear Margaret , do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose ? |	|My life might have been passed in ease and luxury , but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path . |	2	Margaret	DEFAULT								
0.243785309025755	216	|I thank you , ' he replied , ` for your sympathy , but it is useless ; my fate is nearly fulfilled . |	|I wait but for one event , and then I shall repose in peace . |	|I understand your feeling , ' continued he , perceiving that I wished to interrupt him ; ` but you are mistaken , my friend , if thus you will allow me to name you ; nothing can alter my destiny ; listen to my history , and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined . ' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.998061993612423	207	|August 19 , 17 -- Yesterday the stranger said to me , ` You may easily perceive , Captain Walton , that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes . |	|I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me , but you have won me to alter my determination . |	|You seek for knowledge and wisdom , as I once did ; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you , as mine has been . |	2	Walton	DEFAULT								
0.288905323235181	174	|How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief ? |	|He is so gentle , yet so wise ; his mind is so cultivated , and when he speaks , although his words are culled with the choicest art , yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence . |	|He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck , apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.696166286398237	186	|Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught ? |	|Hear me ; let me reveal my tale , and you will dash the cup from your lips !

0.593302567205595	261	|Much as they were attached to each other , they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me . |	|My mother 's tender caresses and my father 's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections . |	|I was their plaything and their idol , and something better -- their child , the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven , whom to bring up to good , and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery , according as they fulfilled their duties towards me . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.554921862694063	75	|He had already bought a farm with his money , on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life ; but he bestowed the whole on his rival , together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock , and then himself solicited the young woman 's father to consent to her marriage with her lover . |	|But the old man decidedly refused , thinking himself bound in honour to my friend , who , when he found the father inexorable , quitted his country , nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations . |	|` What a noble fellow !

0.435907051776931	98	|This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel ; more fortunate than I , who may not see my native land , perhaps , for many years . |	|I am , however , in good spirits : my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose , nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us , indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing , appear to dismay them . |	|We have already reached a very high latitude ; but it is the height of summer , and although not so warm as in England , the southern gales , which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain , breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.1819327351294	63	|Yet some feelings , unallied to the dross of human nature , beat even in these rugged bosoms . |	|My lieutenant , for instance , is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise ; he is madly desirous of glory , or rather , to word my phrase more characteristically , of advancement in his profession . |	|He is an Englishman , and in the midst of national and professional prejudices , unsoftened by cultivation , retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.557429483795382	126	|We , however , lay to until the morning , fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice . |	|I profited of this time to rest for a few hours . |	|In the morning , however , as soon as it was light , I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel , apparently talking to someone in the sea . |	1	DEFAULT

0.714813863273817	71	|This , briefly , is his story . |	|Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune , and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money , the father of the girl consented to the match . |	|He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony ; but she was bathed in tears , and throwing herself at his feet , entreated him to spare her , confessing at the same time that she loved another , but that he was poor , and that her father would never consent to the union . |	1	DEFAULT

0.696043661612481	227	|My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics , and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation . |	|He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business . |	|He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country ; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early , nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family . |	1	DEFAULT

0.919791268771184	264	|With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life , added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both , it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience , of charity , and of self-control , I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me . |	|For a long time I was their only care . |	|My mother had much desired to have a daughter , but I continued their single offspring . |	1	DEFAULT
