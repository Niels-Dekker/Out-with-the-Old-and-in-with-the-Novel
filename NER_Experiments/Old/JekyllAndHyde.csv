0.11121941644009	10	|His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest ; his affections , like ivy , were the growth of time , they implied no aptness in the object . |	|Hence , no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield , his distant kinsman , the well-known man about town . |	|It was a nut to crack for many , what these two could see in each other , or what subject they could find in common . |	2	DEFAULT	Mr. Enfield								
0.58576953012792	78	|`` I feel very strongly about putting questions ; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment . |	|You start a question , and it 's like starting a stone . |	|You sit quietly on the top of a hill ; and away the stone goes , starting others ; and presently some bland old bird -LRB- the last you would have thought of -RRB- is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name . |	1	DEFAULT

0.077118523672155	75	|`` And you never asked about the -- place with the door ? '' |	|said Mr. Utterson . |	|`` No , sir : I had a delicacy , '' was the reply . |	1	Mr. Utterson									
0.459328721960869	100	|He 's an extraordinary looking man , and yet I really can name nothing out of the way . |	|No , sir ; I can make no hand of it ; I ca n't describe him . |	|And it 's not want of memory ; for I declare I can see him this moment . '' |	1	DEFAULT
