whether 	O

Alice 	ORGANIZATION

to 	O
her 	O
feet 	O

for 	O
it 	O
flashed 	O
across 	O
her 	O

that 	O

a 	O

out 	O

burning 	O
with 	O
curiosity 	O

she 	O
ran 	O
across 	O
the 	O

fortunately 	O
was 	O
just 	O
in 	O

it 	O

down 	O
a 	O

another 	O

on 	O
the 	O

round 	O

upon 	O
a 	O
low 	O
curtain 	O

noticed 	O
before 	O

behind 	O
it 	O
was 	O
a 	O
little 	O
door 	O
about 	O
fifteen 	O
inches 	O
high 	O
: 	O
she 	O
tried 	O
the 	O
little 	O
golden 	O
key 	O
in 	O
the 	O
lock 	O
, 	O
and 	O
to 	O
her 	O
great 	O
delight 	O
it 	O
fitted 	O
! 	O
Alice 	PERSON
opened 	O
the 	O
door 	O
and 	O
found 	O
that 	O
it 	O
led 	O
into 	O
a 	O
small 	O
passage 	O
, 	O
not 	O
much 	O
larger 	O
than 	O
a 	O
rat-hole 	O
: 	O
she 	O
knelt 	O
down 	O
and 	O
looked 	O
along 	O
the 	O
passage 	O
into 	O
the 	O
loveliest 	O
garden 	O
you 	O
ever 	O
saw 	O
. 	O
How 	O
she 	O
longed 	O
to 	O
get 	O
out 	O
of 	O
that 	O
dark 	O
hall 	O
, 	O
and 	O
wander 	O
about 	O
among 	O
those 	O
beds 	O
of 	O
bright 	O
flowers 	O
and 	O
those 	O
cool 	O
fountains 	O
, 	O
but 	O
she 	O
could 	O
not 	O
even 	O
get 	O
her 	O
head 	O
through 	O
the 	O
doorway 	O
; 	O
` 	O
and 	O
even 	O
if 	O
my 	O
head 	O
would 	O
go 	O
through 	O
, 	O
' 	O
thought 	O
poor 	O
Alice 	PERSON

` 	O
it 	O
would 	O

of 	O
very 	O
little 	O

without 	O
my 	O

Oh 	O
, 	O
how 	O
I 	O
wish 	O
I 	O
could 	O
shut 	O
up 	O

I 	O

how 	O

' 	O
For 	O
, 	O
you 	O
see 	O
, 	O
so 	O
many 	O
out-of-the-way 	O
things 	O
had 	O
happened 	O
lately 	O
, 	O
that 	O
Alice 	PERSON

begun 	O
to 	O
think 	O
that 	O
very 	O
few 	O
things 	O
indeed 	O
were 	O
really 	O
impossible 	O

There 	O
seemed 	O
to 	O
be 	O
no 	O
use 	O
in 	O
waiting 	O
by 	O
the 	O
little 	O
door 	O
, 	O
so 	O
she 	O
went 	O
back 	O
to 	O
the 	O
table 	O

half 	O
hoping 	O
she 	O
might 	O
find 	O
another 	O

it 	O

at 	O

round 	O
the 	O

of 	O
the 	O

about 	O

up 	O
by 	O
wild 	O
beasts 	O
and 	O
other 	O
unpleasant 	O
things 	O

all 	O

a 	O

you 	O

she 	O
very 	O
seldom 	O

sometimes 	O
she 	O

holding 	O
her 	O

this 	O
generally 	O
