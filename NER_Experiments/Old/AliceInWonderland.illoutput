So O
she O
was O
considering O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
( O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
, O
for O
the O
hot O
day O
made O
her O
feel O
very O
sleepy O
and O
stupid O
) O
, O
whether O
the O
pleasure O
of O
making O
a O
daisy-chain O
would O
be O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
getting O
up O
and O
picking O
the O
daisies O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
White PER
Rabbit PER
with O
pink O
eyes O
ran O
close O
by O
her O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
so O
VERY O
remarkable O
in O
that O
; O
nor O
did O
Alice PER
think O
it O
so O
VERY O
much O
out O
of O
the O
way O
to O
hear O
the O
Rabbit PER
say O
to O
itself O
, O
' O
Oh LOC
dear O
! O
Oh LOC
dear O
! O
I O
shall O
be O
late O
! O
' O
( O
when O
she O
thought O
it O
over O
afterwards O
, O
it O
occurred O
to O
her O
that O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
wondered O
at O
this O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
it O
all O
seemed O
quite O
natural O
) O
; O
but O
when O
the O
Rabbit PER
actually O
TOOK O
A O
WATCH O
OUT O
OF O
ITS O
WAISTCOAT-POCKET O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
it O
, O
and O
then O
hurried O
on O
, O
Alice PER
started O
to O
her O
feet O
, O
for O
it O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
she O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
a O
rabbit O
with O
either O
a O
waistcoat-pocket O
, O
or O
a O
watch O
to O
take O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
burning O
with O
curiosity O
, O
she O
ran O
across O
the O
field O
after O
it O
, O
and O
fortunately O
was O
just O
in O
time O
to O
see O
it O
pop O
down O
a O
large O
rabbit-hole O
under O
the O
hedge O
. O
In O
another O
moment O
down O
went O
Alice PER
after O
it O
, O
never O
once O
considering O
how O
in O
the O
world O
she O
was O
to O
get O
out O
again O
. O
The O
rabbit-hole O
went O
straight O
on O
like O
a O
tunnel O
for O
some O
way O
, O
and O
then O
dipped O
suddenly O
down O
, O
so O
suddenly O
that O
Alice PER
had O
not O
a O
moment O
to O
think O
about O
stopping O
herself O
before O
she O
found O
herself O
falling O
down O
a O
very O
deep O
well O
. O
Either O
the O
well O
was O
very O
deep O
, O
or O
she O
fell O
very O
slowly O
, O
for O
she O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
as O
she O
went O
down O
to O
look O
about O
her O
and O
to O
wonder O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
next O
. O
First O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
look O
down O
and O
make O
out O
what O
she O
was O
coming O
to O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
dark O
to O
see O
anything O
; O
then O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
well O
, O
and O
noticed O
that O
they O
were O
filled O
with O
cupboards O
and O
book-shelves O
; O
here O
and O
there O
she O
saw O
maps O
and O
pictures O
hung O
upon O
pegs O
. O
She O
took O
down O
a O
jar O
from O
one O
of O
the O
shelves O
as O
she O
passed O
; O
it O
was O
labelled O
' O
ORANGE O
MARMALADE O
' O
, O
but O
to O
her O
great O
disappointment O
it O
was O
empty O
: O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
drop O
the O
jar O
for O
fear O
of O
killing O
somebody O
, O
so O
managed O
to O
put O
it O
into O
one O
of O
the O
cupboards O
as O
she O
fell O
past O
it O
. O
' O
Well O
! O
' O
thought O
Alice PER
to O
herself O
, O
' O
after O
such O
a O
fall O
as O
this O
, O
I O
shall O
think O
nothing O
of O
tumbling O
down O
stairs O
! O
How O
brave O
they O
'll O
all O
think O
me O
at O
home O
! O
Why O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
even O
if O
I O
fell O
off O
the O
top O
of O
the O
house O
! O
' O
( O
Which O
was O
very O
likely O
true O
. O
) O
Down O
, O
down O
, O
down O
. O
Would O
the O
fall O
NEVER O
come O
to O
an O
end O
! O
' O
I O
wonder O
how O
many O
miles O
I O
've O
fallen O
by O
this O
time O
? O
' O
she O
said O
aloud O
. O
' O
I O
must O
be O
getting O
somewhere O
near O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
Let O
me O
see O
: O
that O
would O
be O
four O
thousand O
miles O
down O
, O
I O
think O
-- O
' O
( O
for O
, O
you O
see O
, O
Alice PER
had O
learnt O
several O
things O
of O
this O
sort O
in O
her O
lessons O
in O
the O
schoolroom O
, O
and O
though O
this O
was O
not O
a O
VERY O
good O
opportunity O
for O
showing O
off O
her O
knowledge O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
, O
still O
it O
was O
good O
practice O
to O
say O
it O
over O
) O
' O
-- O
yes O
, O
that O
's O
about O
the O
right O
distance O

but O
then O
I O
wonder O
what O
Latitude ORG

I O
've O
got O
to O
? O
' O
( O
Alice PER
had O
no O
idea O
what O
Latitude ORG

, O
or O
Longitude O
either O
, O
but O
thought O
they O
were O
nice O
grand O
words O
to O
say O
. O
) O
Presently O
she O
began O
again O
. O
' O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
shall O
fall O
right O
THROUGH O
the O
earth O
! O
How O
funny O
it O
'll O
seem O
to O
come O
out O
among O
the O
people O

with O
their O
heads O
downward O

The O
Antipathies O

I O

she O

rather O
glad O

I O

what O

it O

Down O

down O

down O

There O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O

so O
Alice PER
soon O
began O
talking O
again O

' O
Dinah PER

miss O
me O
very O
much O
to-night O

I O
should O

the O
cat O

I O

tea-time O

Dinah PER

dear O

I O

down O
here O
with O
me O
! O
There O
are O
no O
mice O
in O
the O
air O
, O
I O
'm O
afraid O

but O
you O
might O
catch O
a O
bat O
, O
and O
that O
's O
very O
like O
a O
mouse O
, O
you O
know O
. O
But O
do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
, O
I O
wonder O
? O
' O
And O
here O
Alice PER
began O
to O
get O
rather O
sleepy O
, O
and O
went O
on O
saying O
to O
herself O
, O
in O
a O
dreamy O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
' O
Do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
? O
Do O
cats O
eat O
bats O
? O
' O
and O
sometimes O
, O
' O
Do O
bats O
eat O
cats O
? O
' O
for O
, O
you O
see O
, O
as O
she O
could O
n't O
answer O
either O
question O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
much O
matter O
which O
way O
she O
put O
it O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
was O
dozing O
off O
, O
and O
had O
just O
begun O
to O
dream O
that O
she O
was O
walking O
hand O
in O
hand O
with O
Dinah PER
, O
and O
saying O
to O
her O
very O
earnestly O
, O
' O
Now O
, O
Dinah PER
, O
tell O
me O
the O
truth O
: O
did O
you O
ever O
eat O
a O
bat O
? O
' O
when O
suddenly O
, O
thump O
! O
thump O
! O
down O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
heap O
of O
sticks O
and O
dry O
leaves O
, O
and O
the O
fall O
was O
over O
. O
Alice PER
was O
not O
a O
bit O
hurt O
, O
and O
she O
jumped O
up O
on O
to O
her O
feet O
in O
a O
moment O
: O
she O
looked O
up O
, O
but O
it O
was O
all O
dark O
overhead O
; O
before O
her O
was O
another O
long O
passage O
, O
and O
the O
White PER
Rabbit PER
was O
still O
in O
sight O
, O
hurrying O
down O
it O
. O
There O
was O
not O
a O
moment O
to O
be O
lost O
: O
away O
went O
Alice PER
like O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
was O
just O
in O
time O
to O
hear O
it O
say O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
a O
corner O
, O
' O
Oh O
my O
ears O
and O
whiskers O
, O
how O
late O
it O
's O
getting O
! O
' O
She O
was O
close O
behind O
it O
when O
she O
turned O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
the O
Rabbit PER
was O
no O
longer O
to O
be O
seen O
: O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
a O
long O
, O
low O
hall O
, O
which O
was O
lit O
up O
by O
a O
row O
of O
lamps O
hanging O
from O
the O
roof O
. O
There O
were O
doors O
all O
round O
the O
hall O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
locked O
; O
and O
when O
Alice PER
had O
been O
all O
the O
way O
down O
one O
side O
and O
up O
the O
other O
, O
trying O
every O
door O
, O
she O
walked O
sadly O
down O
the O
middle O
, O
wondering O
how O
she O
was O
ever O
to O
get O
out O
again O
. O
Suddenly O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
little O
three-legged O
table O
, O
all O
made O
of O
solid O
glass O
; O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
it O
except O
a O
tiny O
golden O
key O
, O
and O
Alice PER
's O
first O
thought O
was O
that O
it O
might O
belong O
to O
one O
of O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
hall O
; O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
either O
the O
locks O
were O
too O
large O
, O
or O
the O
key O
was O
too O
small O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
would O
not O
open O
any O
of O
them O
. O
However O
, O
on O
the O
second O
time O
round O
, O
she O
came O
upon O
a O
low O
curtain O
she O
had O
not O
noticed O
before O
, O
and O
behind O
it O
was O
a O
little O
door O
about O
fifteen O
inches O
high O
: O
she O
tried O
the O
little O
golden O
key O
in O
the O
lock O
, O
and O
to O
her O
great O
delight O
it O
fitted O
! O
Alice PER
opened O
the O
door O
and O
found O
that O
it O
led O
into O
a O
small O
passage O
, O
not O
much O
larger O
than O
a O
rat-hole O
: O
she O
knelt O
down O
and O
looked O
along O
the O
passage O
into O
the O
loveliest O
garden O
you O
ever O
saw O
. O
How O
she O
longed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
that O
dark O
hall O
, O
and O
wander O
about O
among O
those O
beds O
of O
bright O
flowers O
and O
those O
cool O
fountains O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
even O
get O
her O
head O
through O
the O
doorway O
; O
' O
and O
even O
if O
my O
head O
would O
go O
through O
, O
' O
thought O
poor O
Alice PER
, O
' O
it O
would O
be O
of O
very O
little O
use O
without O
my O
shoulders O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
shut O
up O
like O
a O
telescope O
! O
I O
think O
I O
could O
, O
if O
I O
only O
knew O
how O
to O
begin O
. O
' O
For O
, O
you O
see O
, O
so O
many O
out-of-the-way O
things O
had O
happened O
lately O
, O
that O
Alice PER
had O
begun O
to O
think O
that O
very O
few O
things O
indeed O
were O
really O
impossible O
. O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
no O
use O
in O
waiting O
by O
the O
little O
door O
, O
so O
she O
went O
back O
to O
the O
table O
, O
half O
hoping O
she O
might O
find O
another O
key O
on O
it O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O
a O
book O
of O
rules O
for O
shutting O
people O
up O
like O
telescopes O
: O
this O
time O
she O
found O
a O
little O
bottle O
on O
it O
, O
-LSB- O
' O
which O
certainly O
was O
not O
here O
before O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
, O
) O
and O
round O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
bottle O
was O
a O
paper O
label O
, O
with O
the O
words O
' O
DRINK O
ME O
' O
beautifully O
printed O
on O
it O
in O
large O
letters O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
well O
to O
say O
' O
Drink O
me O
, O
' O
but O
the O
wise O
little O
Alice PER
was O
not O
going O
to O
do O
THAT O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
' O
No O
, O
I O
'll O
look O
first O
, O
' O
she O
said O
, O
' O
and O
see O
whether O
it O
's O
marked O
" O
poison O
" O
or O
not O
' O
; O
for O
she O
had O
read O
several O
nice O
little O
histories O
about O
children O
who O
had O
got O
burnt O
, O
and O
eaten O
up O
by O
wild O
beasts O
and O
other O
unpleasant O
things O
, O
all O
because O
they O
WOULD O
not O
remember O
the O
simple O
rules O
their O
friends O
had O
taught O
them O
: O
such O
as O
, O
that O
a O
red-hot O
poker O
will O
burn O
you O
if O
you O
hold O
it O
too O
long O
; O
and O
that O
if O
you O
cut O
your O
finger O
VERY O
deeply O
with O
a O
knife O
, O
it O
usually O
bleeds O
; O
and O
she O
had O
never O
forgotten O
that O
, O
if O
you O
drink O
much O
from O
a O
bottle O
marked O
' O
poison O
, O
' O
it O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
disagree O
with O
you O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
. O
However O
, O
this O
bottle O
was O
NOT O
marked O
' O
poison O
, O
' O
so O
Alice PER
ventured O
to O
taste O
it O
, O
and O
finding O
it O
very O
nice O
, O
( O
it O
had O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
mixed O
flavour O
of O
cherry-tart O
, O
custard O
, O
pine-apple O
, O
roast O
turkey LOC
, O
toffee O
, O
and O
hot O
buttered O
toast O

she O
very O
soon O
finished O
it O
off O

' O
What O
a O
curious O
feeling O
! O
' O
said O
Alice PER
; O
' O
I O
must O
be O
shutting O
up O
like O
a O
telescope O
. O
' O
And O
so O
it O
was O
indeed O
: O
she O
was O
now O
only O
ten O
inches O
high O
, O
and O
her O
face O
brightened O
up O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
she O
was O
now O
the O
right O
size O
for O
going O
through O
the O
little O
door O
into O
that O
lovely O
garden O

First O
, O
however O
, O
she O
waited O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
see O
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
shrink O
any O
further O
: O
she O
felt O
a O
little O
nervous O
about O
this O
; O
' O
for O
it O
might O
end O
, O
you O
know O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
to O
herself O
, O
' O
in O
my O
going O
out O
altogether O

like O
a O
candle O

I O
wonder O
what O
I O

she O
tried O
to O
fancy O
what O
the O
flame O
of O
a O
candle O
is O
like O
after O
the O
candle O
is O
blown O
out O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
ever O
having O
seen O
such O
a O
thing O
. O
After O
a O
while O
, O
finding O
that O
nothing O
more O
happened O
, O
she O
decided O
on O
going O
into O
the O
garden O
at O
once O
; O
but O
, O
alas O
for O
poor O
Alice PER
! O
when O
she O
got O
to O
the O
door O
, O
she O
found O
she O
had O
forgotten O
the O
little O
golden O
key O
, O
and O
when O
she O
went O
back O
to O
the O
table O
for O
it O
, O
she O
found O
she O
could O
not O
possibly O
reach O
it O
: O
she O
could O
see O
it O
quite O
plainly O
through O
the O
glass O
, O
and O
she O
tried O
her O
best O
to O
climb O
up O
one O
of O
the O
legs O
of O
the O
table O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
slippery O
; O
and O
when O
she O
had O
tired O
herself O
out O
with O
trying O
, O
the O
poor O
little O
thing O
sat O
down O
and O
cried O
. O
' O
Come O
, O
there O
's O
no O
use O
in O
crying O
like O
that O
! O
' O
said O
Alice PER
to O
herself O
, O
rather O
sharply O
; O
' O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
leave O
off O
this O
minute O
! O
' O
She O
generally O
gave O
herself O
very O
good O
advice O
, O
( O
though O
she O
very O
seldom O
followed O
it O
) O
, O
and O
sometimes O
she O
scolded O
herself O
so O
severely O
as O
to O
bring O
tears O
into O
her O
eyes O
; O
and O
once O
she O
remembered O
trying O
to O
box O
her O
own O
ears O
for O
having O
cheated O
herself O
in O
a O
game O
of O
croquet O
she O
was O
playing O
against O
herself O
, O
for O
this O
curious O
child O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
pretending O
to O
be O
two O
people O
. O
' O
But O
it O
's O
no O
use O
now O
, O
' O
thought O
poor O
Alice PER
, O
' O
to O
pretend O
to O
be O
two O
people O
! O
Why O
, O
there O
's O
hardly O
enough O
of O
me O
left O
to O
make O
ONE O
respectable O
person O
! O
' O
Soon O
her O
eye O
fell O
on O
a O
little O
glass O
box O
that O
was O
lying O
under O
the O
table O
: O
she O
opened O
it O
, O
and O
found O
in O
it O
a O
very O
small O
cake O
, O
on O
which O
the O
words O
' O
EAT O
ME O
' O
were O
beautifully O
marked O
in O
currants O
. O
' O
Well O
, O
I O
'll O
eat O
it O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
, O
' O
and O
if O
it O
makes O
me O
grow O
larger O
, O
I O
can O
reach O
the O
key O
; O
and O
if O
it O
makes O
me O
grow O
smaller O
, O
I O
can O
creep O
under O
the O
door O
; O
so O
either O
way O
I O
'll O
get O
into O
the O
garden O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
which O
happens O
! O
' O
She O
ate O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
and O
said O
anxiously O
to O
herself O
, O
' O
Which O
way O
? O
Which O
way O
? O
' O
, O
holding O
her O
hand O
on O
the O
top O
of O
her O
head O
to O
feel O
which O
way O
it O
was O
growing O
, O
and O
she O
was O
quite O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
she O
remained O
the O
same O
size O
: O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
this O
generally O
happens O
when O
one O
eats O
cake O
, O
but O
Alice PER
had O
got O
so O
much O
into O
the O
way O
of O
expecting O
nothing O
but O
out-of-the-way O
things O
to O
happen O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
quite O
dull O
and O
stupid O
for O
life O
to O
go O
on O
in O
the O
common O
way O
. O
So O
she O
set O
to O
work O
, O
and O
very O
soon O
finished O
off O
the O
cake O
. O

Oh O

what O

' O
Just O
then O
her O
head O
struck O
against O
the O

in O

she O
was O
now O
more O

nine O

she O
at O
once O

up O
the O

off O

Poor O
Alice PER

It O
was O
as O
much O
as O
she O
could O
do O
, O
lying O
down O
on O
one O
side O
, O
to O
look O
through O
into O
the O
garden O
with O
one O
eye O
; O
but O
to O
get O
through O
was O
more O
hopeless O
than O
ever O
: O
she O
sat O
down O
and O
began O
to O
cry O
again O
. O
' O
You O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
yourself O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER

' O
a O
great O
girl O

you O

' O
( O
she O
might O
well O

this O
) O
, O
' O
to O
go O

in O
this O
way O
! O
Stop O
this O
moment O

I O

' O
But O
she O
went O
on O
all O
the O

, O
shedding O
gallons O
of O
tears O
, O
until O
there O
was O
a O
large O
pool O
all O
round O
her O
, O
about O
four O
inches O
deep O
and O
reaching O
half O
down O
the O
hall O
. O
After O
a O
time O
she O
heard O
a O
little O
pattering O
of O
feet O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
dried O
her O
eyes O
to O
see O
what O
was O
coming O

It O
was O
the O
White PER

, O
splendidly O
dressed O

with O
a O

of O
white O
kid O
gloves O

a O
large O
fan O
in O

he O
came O
trotting O
along O
in O
a O

to O
himself O

came O

' O

' O
Alice PER

so O
desperate O
that O
she O
was O

any O
one O

so O
, O
when O
the O

her O

she O

in O

low O
, O
timid O
voice O
, O
' O
If O
you O

' O
The O

violently O

dropped O
the O

the O

skurried O
away O

go O

Alice PER
took O
up O
the O
fan O
and O
gloves O
, O
and O
, O
as O
the O
hall O
was O
very O
hot O
, O
she O
kept O
fanning O
herself O
all O
the O
time O
she O
went O
on O
talking O

everything O

yesterday O
things O

me O

I O

up O

if O
I O

Ah O

THAT O

the O
great O
puzzle O

first O
idea O
was O
that O
she O
had O
somehow O
fallen O
into O
the O
sea O

in O
that O
case O
I O
can O
go O
back O

she O

to O
herself O

( O
Alice PER

been O
to O
the O
seaside O
once O
in O
her O
life O
, O
and O
had O
come O
to O
the O
general O
conclusion O
, O
that O
wherever O
you O
go O
to O
on O
the O
English MISC
coast O
you O
find O
a O
number O
of O
bathing O
machines O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
some O
children O
digging O
in O
the O
sand O
with O
wooden O
spades O
, O
then O
a O
row O
of O
lodging O
houses O
, O
and O
behind O
them O
a O
railway O
station O
. O
) O
However O
, O
she O
soon O
made O
out O
that O
she O
was O
in O
the O
pool O
of O
tears O
which O
she O
had O
wept O
when O
she O
was O
nine O
feet O
high O
. O
' O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
n't O
cried O
so O
much O
! O
' O
said O
Alice PER
, O
as O
she O
swam O
about O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
her O
way O
out O
. O
' O
I O
shall O
be O
punished O
for O
it O
now O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
by O
being O
drowned O
in O
my O
own O
tears O
! O
That O
WILL O
be O
a O
queer O
thing O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
However O
, O
everything O
is O
queer O
to-day O
. O
' O
Just O
then O
she O
heard O
something O
splashing O
about O
in O
the O
pool O
a O
little O
way O
off O
, O
and O
she O
swam O
nearer O
to O
make O
out O
what O
it O
was O
: O
at O
first O
she O
thought O
it O
must O
be O
a O
walrus O
or O
hippopotamus O
, O
but O
then O
she O
remembered O
how O
small O
she O
was O
now O
, O
and O
she O
soon O
made O
out O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
mouse O
that O
had O
slipped O
in O
like O
herself O
. O
' O
Would O
it O
be O
of O
any O
use O

now O

' O
thought O
Alice PER

' O
to O
speak O
to O
this O
mouse O

so O
out-of-the-way O
down O
here O

I O

any O
rate O

there O

no O
harm O
in O

she O
began O
: O
' O
O O

you O

' O
( O
Alice PER

this O

the O
right O

to O

she O
had O
never O
done O

The O

at O

inquisitively O

to O
her O
to O
wink O
with O
one O
of O

it O

nothing O

again O

the O

The O

a O
sudden O
leap O
out O
of O

to O
quiver O
all O
over O

fright O

a O

' O
One O
, O
two O
, O
three O
, O
and O
away O
, O
' O
but O
they O
began O
running O
when O
they O
liked O
, O
and O
left O
off O
when O
they O
liked O
, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
not O
easy O
to O
know O
when O
the O
race O
was O
over O
. O
However O
, O
when O
they O
had O
been O
running O
half O
an O
hour O
or O
so O
, O
and O
were O
quite O
dry O
again O
, O
the O
Dodo MISC
suddenly O
called O
out O
' O
The O
race O
is O
over O
! O
' O
and O
they O
all O
crowded O
round O
it O
, O
panting O
, O
and O
asking O
, O
' O
But O
who O
has O
won O
? O
' O
This O
question O
the O
Dodo MISC
could O
not O
answer O
without O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
thought O
, O
and O
it O
sat O
for O
a O
long O
time O
with O
one O
finger O
pressed O
upon O
its O
forehead O
( O
the O
position O
in O
which O
you O
usually O
see O
Shakespeare LOC
, O
in O
the O
pictures O
of O
him O
) O
, O
while O
the O
rest O
waited O
in O
silence O
. O
At O
last O
the O
Dodo MISC
said O
, O
' O
EVERYBODY O
has O
won O
, O
and O
all O
must O
have O
prizes O
. O
' O
' O
But O
who O
is O
to O
give O
the O
prizes O
? O
' O
quite O
a O
chorus O
of O
voices O
asked O
. O
' O
Why O
, O
SHE O
, O
of O
course O
, O
' O
said O
the O
Dodo MISC
, O
pointing O
to O
Alice PER
with O
one O
finger O
; O
and O
the O
whole O
party O
at O
once O
crowded O
round O
her O
, O
calling O
out O
in O
a O
confused O
way O
, O
' O
Prizes O
! O
Prizes O
! O
' O
Alice PER
had O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
, O
and O
in O
despair O
she O
put O
her O
hand O
in O
her O
pocket O
, O
and O
pulled O
out O
a O
box O
of O
comfits O
, O
( O
luckily O
the O
salt O
water O
had O
not O
got O
into O
it O
) O
, O
and O
handed O
them O
round O
as O
prizes O
. O
There O
was O
exactly O
one O
a-piece O
all O
round O
. O
' O
But O
she O
must O
have O
a O
prize O
herself O
, O
you O
know O
, O
' O
said O
the O
Mouse PER
. O
' O
Of O
course O
, O
' O
the O
Dodo MISC
replied O
very O
gravely O
. O
' O
What O
else O
have O
you O
got O
in O
your O
pocket O
? O
' O
he O
went O
on O
, O
turning O
to O
Alice PER
. O
' O
Only O
a O
thimble O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
sadly O
. O
' O
Hand O
it O
over O
here O
, O
' O
said O
the O
Dodo MISC
. O
Then O
they O
all O
crowded O
round O
her O
once O
more O
, O
while O
the O
Dodo MISC
solemnly O
presented O
the O
thimble O
, O
saying O
' O
We O
beg O
your O
acceptance O
of O
this O
elegant O
thimble O
' O
; O
and O
, O
when O
it O
had O
finished O
this O
short O
speech O
, O
they O
all O
cheered O
. O
Alice PER
thought O
the O
whole O
thing O
very O
absurd O
, O
but O
they O
all O
looked O
so O
grave O
that O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
laugh O
; O
and O
, O
as O
she O
could O
not O
think O
of O
anything O
to O
say O
, O
she O
simply O
bowed O
, O
and O
took O
the O
thimble O
, O
looking O
as O
solemn O
as O
she O
could O
. O
The O
next O
thing O
was O
to O
eat O
the O
comfits O
: O
this O
caused O
some O
noise O
and O
confusion O
, O
as O
the O
large O
birds O
complained O
that O
they O
could O
not O
taste O
theirs O
, O
and O
the O
small O
ones O
choked O
and O
had O
to O
be O
patted O
on O
the O
back O
. O
However O
, O
it O
was O
over O
at O
last O
, O
and O
they O
sat O
down O
again O
in O
a O
ring O
, O
and O
begged O
the O
Mouse PER
to O
tell O
them O
something O
more O
. O
' O
You O
promised O
to O
tell O
me O
your O
history O
, O
you O
know O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
, O
' O
and O
why O
it O
is O
you O
hate O
-- O
C O
and O
D O
, O
' O
she O
added O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
half O
afraid O
that O
it O
would O
be O
offended O
again O
. O
' O
Mine O
is O
a O
long O
and O
a O
sad O
tale O
! O
' O
said O
the O
Mouse PER
, O
turning O
to O
Alice PER
, O
and O
sighing O
. O
' O
It O
IS O
a O
long O
tail O
, O
certainly O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
, O
looking O
down O
with O
wonder O
at O
the O
Mouse PER
's O
tail O
; O
' O
but O
why O
do O
you O
call O
it O
sad O
? O
' O
And O
she O
kept O
on O
puzzling O
about O
it O
while O
the O
Mouse PER
was O
speaking O
, O
so O
that O
her O
idea O
of O
the O
tale O
was O
something O
like O
this O
: O
-- O
' O
Fury O
said O
to O
a O
mouse O
, O
That O
he O
met O
in O
the O
house O
, O
" O
Let O
us O
both O
go O
to O
law O
: O
I O
will O
prosecute O
YOU O
. O
-- O
Come O
, O
I O
'll O
take O
no O
denial O
; O
We O
must O
have O
a O
trial O
: O
For O
really O
this O
morning O
I O
've O
nothing O
to O
do O
. O
" O
Said O
the O
mouse O
to O
the O
cur O
, O
" O
Such O
a O
trial O
, O
dear O
Sir O
, O
With O
no O
jury O
or O
judge O
, O
would O
be O
wasting O
our O
breath O
. O
" O
" O
I O
'll O
be O
judge O
, O
I O
'll O
be O
jury O
, O
" O
Said O
cunning O
old O
Fury O
: O
" O
I O
'll O
try O
the O
whole O
cause O
, O
and O
condemn O
you O
to O
death O
. O
" O
' O
' O
You O
are O
not O
attending O
! O
' O
said O
the O
Mouse PER
to O
Alice PER
severely O
. O
' O
What O
are O
you O
thinking O
of O
? O
' O
' O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
' O
said O
Alice PER
very O
humbly O
: O
' O
you O
had O
got O
to O
the O
fifth O
bend O
, O
I O
think O
? O
' O
' O
I O
had O
NOT O
! O
' O
cried O
the O
Mouse PER
, O
sharply O
and O
very O
angrily O
. O
' O
A O
knot O
! O
' O
said O
Alice PER
, O
always O
ready O
to O
make O
herself O
useful O
, O
and O
looking O
anxiously O
about O
her O
. O
' O
Oh O
, O
do O
let O
me O
help O
to O
undo O
it O
! O
' O
' O
I O
shall O
do O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
, O
' O
said O
the O
Mouse PER
, O
getting O
up O
and O
walking O
away O
. O
' O
You O
insult O
me O
by O
talking O
such O
nonsense O
! O
' O
' O
I O
did O
n't O
mean O
it O
! O
' O
pleaded O
poor O
Alice PER
. O
' O
But O
you O
're O
so O
easily O
offended O
, O
you O
know O
! O
' O
The O
Mouse PER
only O
growled O
in O
reply O
. O
' O
Please O
come O
back O
and O
finish O
your O
story O
! O
' O
Alice PER
called O
after O
it O
; O
and O
the O
others O
all O
joined O
in O
chorus O
, O
' O
Yes O
, O
please O
do O
! O
' O
but O
the O
Mouse PER
only O
shook O
its O
head O
impatiently O
, O
and O
walked O
a O
little O
quicker O
. O
' O
What O
a O
pity O
it O
would O
n't O
stay O
! O
' O
sighed O
the O
Lory PER
, O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
quite O
out O
of O
sight O
; O
and O
an O
old O
Crab O
took O
the O
opportunity O
of O
saying O
to O
her O
daughter O
' O
Ah O
, O
my O
dear O
! O
Let O
this O
be O
a O
lesson O
to O
you O
never O
to O
lose O
YOUR O
temper O
! O
' O
' O
Hold O
your O
tongue O
, O
Ma PER
! O
' O
said O
the O
young O
Crab O
, O
a O
little O
snappishly O
. O
' O
You O
're O
enough O
to O
try O
the O
patience O
of O
an O
oyster O
! O
' O
' O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
our O
Dinah PER
here O
, O
I O
know O
I O
do O
! O
' O
said O
Alice PER
aloud O
, O
addressing O
nobody O
in O
particular O
. O
' O
She O
'd O
soon O
fetch O
it O
back O
! O
' O
' O
And O
who O
is O
Dinah PER
, O
if O
I O
might O
venture O
to O
ask O
the O
question O
? O
' O
said O
the O
Lory PER
. O
Alice PER
replied O
eagerly O
, O
for O
she O
was O
always O
ready O
to O
talk O
about O
her O
pet O
: O
' O
Dinah PER
's O
our O
cat O
. O
And O
she O
's O
such O
a O
capital O
one O
for O
catching O
mice O
you O
ca O
n't O
think O
! O
And O
oh O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
see O
her O
after O
the O
birds O
! O
Why O
, O
she O
'll O
eat O
a O
little O
bird O
as O
soon O
as O
look O
at O
it O
! O
' O
This O
speech O
caused O
a O
remarkable O
sensation O
among O
the O
party O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
birds O
hurried O
off O
at O
once O
: O
one O
old O
Magpie MISC
began O
wrapping O
itself O
up O
very O
carefully O
, O
remarking O
, O
' O
I O
really O
must O
be O
getting O
home O
; O
the O
night-air O
does O
n't O
suit O
my O
throat O
! O
' O
and O
a O
Canary O
called O
out O
in O
a O
trembling O
voice O
to O
its O
children O
, O
' O
Come O
away O
, O
my O
dears O
! O
It O
's O
high O
time O
you O
were O
all O
in O
bed O
! O
' O
On O
various O
pretexts O
they O
all O
moved O
off O
, O
and O
Alice PER
was O
soon O
left O
alone O
. O
' O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
n't O
mentioned O
Dinah PER
! O
' O
she O
said O
to O
herself O
in O
a O
melancholy O
tone O
. O
' O
Nobody O
seems O
to O
like O
her O
, O
down O
here O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
she O
's O
the O
best O
cat O
in O
the O
world O
! O
Oh O
, O
my O
dear O
Dinah PER
! O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
shall O
ever O
see O
you O
any O
more O
! O
' O
And O
here O
poor O
Alice PER
began O
to O
cry O
again O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
very O
lonely O
and O
low-spirited O
. O
In O
a O
little O
while O
, O
however O
, O
she O
again O
heard O
a O
little O
pattering O
of O
footsteps O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
up O
eagerly O
, O
half O
hoping O
that O
the O
Mouse PER
had O
changed O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
was O
coming O
back O
to O
finish O
his O
story O
