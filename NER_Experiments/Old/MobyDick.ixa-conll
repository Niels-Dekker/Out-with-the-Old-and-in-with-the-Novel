, 	O
I 	O
always 	O
go 	O

never 	O

ever 	O

the 	O
contrary 	O

there 	O

difference 	O
in 	O
the 	O

The 	O

the 	O

The 	O

a 	O

really 	O

your 	O

in 	O
the 	O

what 	O

after 	O

was 	O

Remembering 	O
the 	O

at 	O
first 	O
I 	O
almost 	O
thought 	O
that 	O
this 	O

was 	O
a 	O

and 	O
that 	O
it 	O
glistened 	O
a 	O

I 	O
concluded 	O
that 	O
it 	O

now 	O

removing 	O
the 	O

many 	O

still 	O

of 	O

he 	O
at 	O

the 	O

the 	O

at 	O

he 	O
never 	O

All 	O
these 	O
strange 	O

were 	O
accompanied 	O
by 	O
still 	O
stranger 	O
guttural 	O
noises 	O
from 	O
the 	O

his 	O

At 	O
last 	O
extinguishing 	O
the 	O

he 	O
took 	O
the 	O

up 	O

unceremoniously 	O

and 	O
bagged 	O
it 	O
again 	O
in 	O

All 	O
these 	O
queer 	O

increased 	O
my 	O

seeing 	O
him 	O

the 	O

what 	O

Taking 	O
up 	O
his 	O

the 	O

with 	O
his 	O

The 	O
next 	O

this 	O

sprang 	O

I 	O
sang 	O
out 	O

I 	O

it 	O
now 	O

a 	O

Stammering 	O
out 	O
something 	O

I 	O
knew 	O

I 	O
rolled 	O
away 	O
from 	O
him 	O

conjured 	O

his 	O

satisfied 	O
