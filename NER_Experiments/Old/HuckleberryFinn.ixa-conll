it 	O
was 	O
piled 	O
up 	O

The 	O
Widow 	O
Douglas 	PERSON
she 	O
took 	O
me 	O
for 	O
her 	O
son 	O
, 	O
and 	O
allowed 	O
she 	O
would 	O
sivilize 	O
me 	O
; 	O
but 	O
it 	O
was 	O
rough 	O
living 	O
in 	O
the 	O
house 	O
all 	O
the 	O
time 	O
, 	O
considering 	O
how 	O
dismal 	O

decent 	O
the 	O
widow 	O
was 	O
in 	O
all 	O
her 	O
ways 	O
; 	O
and 	O
so 	O
when 	O
I 	O
could 	O
n't 	O
stand 	O
it 	O
no 	O
longer 	O
I 	O
lit 	O
out 	O
. 	O
I 	O
got 	O
into 	O
my 	O
old 	O
rags 	O
and 	O
my 	O
sugar-hogshead 	O
again 	O
, 	O
and 	O
was 	O
free 	O
and 	O
satisfied 	O
. 	O
But 	O
Tom 	PERSON
Sawyer 	PERSON
he 	O
hunted 	O
me 	O
up 	O
and 	O
said 	O
he 	O
was 	O
going 	O
to 	O
start 	O
a 	O
band 	O
of 	O
robbers 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
might 	O
join 	O
if 	O
I 	O
would 	O
go 	O
back 	O
to 	O
the 	O
widow 	O
and 	O
be 	O
respectable 	O
. 	O
So 	O
I 	O
went 	O
back 	O
. 	O
The 	O
widow 	O
she 	O
cried 	O
over 	O
me 	O
, 	O
and 	O
called 	O
me 	O
a 	O
poor 	O
lost 	O
lamb 	O
, 	O
and 	O
she 	O
called 	O
me 	O
a 	O
lot 	O
of 	O
other 	O
names 	O
, 	O
too 	O
, 	O
but 	O
she 	O
never 	O
meant 	O
no 	O
harm 	O
by 	O
it 	O
. 	O
She 	O
put 	O
me 	O
in 	O
them 	O
new 	O
clothes 	O
again 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
could 	O
n't 	O

nothing 	O

sweat 	O
and 	O
sweat 	O
, 	O
and 	O
feel 	O
all 	O
cramped 	O
up 	O
. 	O
Well 	O
, 	O
then 	O
, 	O
the 	O
old 	O
thing 	O
commenced 	O
again 	O
. 	O
The 	O
widow 	O
rung 	O
a 	O
bell 	O
for 	O
supper 	O
, 	O
and 	O
you 	O
had 	O
to 	O
come 	O
to 	O
time 	O
. 	O
When 	O
you 	O
got 	O
to 	O
the 	O
table 	O
you 	O
could 	O
n't 	O
go 	O
right 	O
to 	O
eating 	O
, 	O
but 	O
you 	O
had 	O
to 	O
wait 	O
for 	O
the 	O
widow 	O
to 	O
tuck 	O
down 	O
her 	O
head 	O
and 	O
grumble 	O
a 	O
little 	O
over 	O
the 	O
victuals 	O
, 	O
though 	O
there 	O
war 	O
n't 	O
really 	O
anything 	O
the 	O
matter 	O
with 	O
them 	O
, 	O
-- 	O
that 	O
is 	O
, 	O
nothing 	O
only 	O
everything 	O
was 	O
cooked 	O
by 	O
itself 	O
. 	O
In 	O
a 	O
barrel 	O
of 	O
odds 	O
and 	O
ends 	O
it 	O
is 	O
different 	O
; 	O
things 	O

up 	O

and 	O
the 	O

kind 	O
of 	O
swaps 	O
around 	O
, 	O
and 	O
the 	O
things 	O
go 	O
better 	O
. 	O
After 	O
supper 	O
she 	O
got 	O
out 	O
her 	O
book 	O
and 	O
learned 	O
me 	O
about 	O
Moses 	PERSON
and 	O
the 	O
Bulrushers 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
was 	O
in 	O
a 	O
sweat 	O
to 	O
find 	O
out 	O
all 	O
about 	O
him 	O
; 	O
but 	O
by 	O
and 	O
by 	O
she 	O
let 	O
it 	O
out 	O
that 	O
Moses 	PERSON
had 	O
been 	O
dead 	O
a 	O
considerable 	O
long 	O
time 	O
; 	O
so 	O
then 	O
I 	O
did 	O
n't 	O
care 	O
no 	O
more 	O
about 	O
him 	O
, 	O
because 	O
I 	O
do 	O
n't 	O
take 	O
no 	O
stock 	O
in 	O
dead 	O
people 	O
. 	O
Pretty 	O
soon 	O
I 	O
wanted 	O
to 	O
smoke 	O
, 	O
and 	O
asked 	O
the 	O
widow 	O
to 	O
let 	O
me 	O
. 	O
But 	O
she 	O
would 	O
n't 	O
. 	O
She 	O
said 	O
it 	O
was 	O
a 	O
mean 	O
practice 	O
and 	O
was 	O
n't 	O
clean 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
must 	O
try 	O
to 	O
not 	O
do 	O
it 	O
any 	O
more 	O
. 	O
That 	O
is 	O
just 	O
the 	O
way 	O
with 	O
some 	O
people 	O
. 	O
They 	O
get 	O
down 	O
on 	O
a 	O
thing 	O
when 	O
they 	O
do 	O
n't 	O
know 	O
nothing 	O
about 	O
it 	O
. 	O
Here 	O
she 	O
was 	O
a-bothering 	O
about 	O
Moses 	PERSON
, 	O
which 	O
was 	O
no 	O
kin 	O
to 	O
her 	O
, 	O
and 	O
no 	O
use 	O
to 	O
anybody 	O
, 	O
being 	O
gone 	O
, 	O
you 	O
see 	O
, 	O
yet 	O
finding 	O
a 	O
power 	O
of 	O
fault 	O
with 	O
me 	O
for 	O
doing 	O
a 	O
thing 	O
that 	O
had 	O
some 	O
good 	O
in 	O
it 	O
. 	O
And 	O
she 	O
took 	O
snuff 	O
, 	O
too 	O
; 	O
of 	O
course 	O
that 	O
was 	O
all 	O
right 	O
, 	O
because 	O
she 	O
done 	O
it 	O
herself 	O
. 	O
Her 	O
sister 	O
, 	O
Miss 	PERSON
Watson 	PERSON
, 	O
a 	O
tolerable 	O
slim 	O
old 	O
maid 	O
, 	O
with 	O
goggles 	O
on 	O
, 	O
had 	O
just 	O
come 	O
to 	O
live 	O
with 	O
her 	O
, 	O
and 	O
took 	O
a 	O
set 	O
at 	O
me 	O
now 	O
with 	O
a 	O
spelling-book 	O
. 	O
She 	O
worked 	O
me 	O
middling 	O
hard 	O
for 	O
about 	O
an 	O
hour 	O
, 	O
and 	O
then 	O
the 	O
widow 	O
made 	O
her 	O
ease 	O
up 	O
. 	O
I 	O
could 	O
n't 	O
stood 	O
it 	O
much 	O
longer 	O
. 	O
Then 	O
for 	O
an 	O
hour 	O
it 	O
was 	O
deadly 	O
dull 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
was 	O
fidgety 	O
. 	O
Miss 	O
Watson 	PERSON
would 	O
say 	O
, 	O
`` 	O
Do 	O
n't 	O
put 	O
your 	O
feet 	O
up 	O
there 	O

Huckleberry 	PERSON

'' 	O
and 	O
`` 	O
Do 	O
n't 	O
scrunch 	O
up 	O

that 	O

Huckleberry 	ORGANIZATION

set 	O
up 	O
straight 	O
; 	O
'' 	O
and 	O
pretty 	O
soon 	O
she 	O
would 	O
say 	O
, 	O
`` 	O
Do 	O
n't 	O
gap 	O
and 	O
stretch 	O
like 	O

-- 	O
why 	O
do 	O
n't 	O
you 	O
try 	O
to 	O
behave 	O
? 	O
'' 	O
Then 	O
she 	O
told 	O
me 	O
all 	O
about 	O
the 	O
bad 	O
place 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
said 	O
I 	O
wished 	O
I 	O
was 	O
there 	O
. 	O
She 	O
got 	O
mad 	O
then 	O
, 	O
but 	O
I 	O
did 	O
n't 	O
mean 	O
no 	O
harm 	O
. 	O
All 	O
I 	O
wanted 	O
was 	O
to 	O
go 	O
somewheres 	O
; 	O
all 	O
I 	O
wanted 	O
was 	O
a 	O
change 	O
, 	O
I 	O
war 	O
n't 	O
particular 	O
. 	O
She 	O
said 	O
it 	O
was 	O
wicked 	O
to 	O
say 	O
what 	O
I 	O
said 	O
; 	O
said 	O
she 	O
would 	O
n't 	O
say 	O
it 	O
for 	O
the 	O
whole 	O
world 	O
; 	O
she 	O
was 	O
going 	O
to 	O
live 	O
so 	O
as 	O
to 	O
go 	O
to 	O
the 	O
good 	O
place 	O
. 	O
Well 	O
, 	O
I 	O
could 	O
n't 	O
see 	O
no 	O
advantage 	O
in 	O
going 	O
where 	O
she 	O
was 	O
going 	O
, 	O
so 	O
I 	O
made 	O
up 	O
my 	O
mind 	O
I 	O
would 	O
n't 	O
try 	O
for 	O
it 	O
. 	O
But 	O
I 	O
never 	O
said 	O
so 	O
, 	O
because 	O
it 	O
would 	O
only 	O
make 	O
trouble 	O
, 	O
and 	O
would 	O
n't 	O
do 	O
no 	O
good 	O
. 	O
Now 	O
she 	O
had 	O
got 	O
a 	O
start 	O
, 	O
and 	O
she 	O
went 	O
on 	O
and 	O
told 	O
me 	O
all 	O
about 	O
the 	O
good 	O
place 	O
. 	O
She 	O
said 	O
all 	O
a 	O
body 	O
would 	O
have 	O
to 	O
do 	O
there 	O
was 	O
to 	O
go 	O
around 	O
all 	O
day 	O
long 	O
with 	O
a 	O
harp 	O
and 	O
sing 	O
, 	O
forever 	O
and 	O
ever 	O
. 	O
So 	O
I 	O
did 	O
n't 	O
think 	O
much 	O
of 	O
it 	O
. 	O
But 	O
I 	O
never 	O
said 	O
so 	O
. 	O
I 	O
asked 	O
her 	O
if 	O
she 	O
reckoned 	O
Tom 	PERSON
Sawyer 	PERSON
would 	O
go 	O
there 	O
, 	O
and 	O
she 	O
said 	O
not 	O
by 	O
a 	O
considerable 	O
sight 	O
. 	O
I 	O
was 	O
glad 	O
about 	O
that 	O
, 	O
because 	O
I 	O
wanted 	O
him 	O
and 	O
me 	O
to 	O
be 	O
together 	O
. 	O
Miss 	PERSON
Watson 	PERSON
she 	O
kept 	O
pecking 	O
at 	O
me 	O
, 	O
and 	O
it 	O
got 	O
tiresome 	O
and 	O
lonesome 	O
. 	O
By 	O
and 	O
by 	O
they 	O
fetched 	O
the 	O
niggers 	O
in 	O
and 	O
had 	O
prayers 	O
, 	O
and 	O
then 	O
everybody 	O
was 	O
off 	O
to 	O
bed 	O
. 	O
I 	O
went 	O
up 	O
to 	O
my 	O
room 	O
with 	O
a 	O
piece 	O
of 	O
candle 	O
, 	O
and 	O
put 	O
it 	O
on 	O
the 	O
table 	O

Then 	O
I 	O
set 	O
down 	O
in 	O
a 	O
chair 	O
by 	O
the 	O
window 	O
and 	O
tried 	O
to 	O
think 	O
of 	O
something 	O
cheerful 	O
, 	O
but 	O
it 	O
war 	O
n't 	O
no 	O
use 	O
. 	O
I 	O
felt 	O
so 	O
lonesome 	O
I 	O
most 	O
wished 	O
I 	O
was 	O
dead 	O
. 	O
The 	O
stars 	O
were 	O
shining 	O
, 	O
and 	O
the 	O
leaves 	O
rustled 	O
in 	O
the 	O
woods 	O
ever 	O
so 	O
mournful 	O
; 	O
and 	O
I 	O
heard 	O
an 	O
owl 	O
, 	O
away 	O
off 	O
, 	O
who-whooing 	O
about 	O
somebody 	O
that 	O
was 	O
dead 	O
, 	O
and 	O
a 	O
whippowill 	O
and 	O
a 	O
dog 	O
crying 	O
about 	O
somebody 	O
that 	O
was 	O
going 	O
to 	O
die 	O
; 	O
and 	O
the 	O
wind 	O
was 	O
trying 	O
to 	O
whisper 	O
something 	O
to 	O
me 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
could 	O
n't 	O
make 	O
out 	O
what 	O
it 	O
was 	O
, 	O
and 	O
so 	O
it 	O
made 	O
the 	O
cold 	O
shivers 	O
run 	O
over 	O
me 	O
. 	O
Then 	O
away 	O
out 	O
in 	O
the 	O
woods 	O
I 	O
heard 	O
that 	O
kind 	O
of 	O
a 	O
sound 	O
that 	O
a 	O
ghost 	O
makes 	O
when 	O
it 	O
wants 	O
to 	O
tell 	O
about 	O
something 	O
that 	O
's 	O
on 	O
its 	O
mind 	O
and 	O
ca 	O
n't 	O
make 	O
itself 	O
understood 	O
, 	O
and 	O
so 	O
ca 	O
n't 	O
rest 	O
easy 	O
in 	O
its 	O
grave 	O
, 	O
and 	O
has 	O
to 	O
go 	O
about 	O
that 	O
way 	O
every 	O
night 	O
grieving 	O
. 	O
I 	O
got 	O
so 	O
down-hearted 	O
and 	O
scared 	O
I 	O
did 	O
wish 	O
I 	O
had 	O
some 	O
company 	O
. 	O
Pretty 	O
soon 	O
a 	O
spider 	O
went 	O
crawling 	O
up 	O
my 	O
shoulder 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
flipped 	O
it 	O
off 	O
and 	O
it 	O
lit 	O
in 	O
the 	O
candle 	O
; 	O
and 	O

most 	O
shook 	O
the 	O
clothes 	O
off 	O
of 	O
