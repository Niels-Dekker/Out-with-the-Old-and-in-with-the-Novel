0.379435501732191	56	|Occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing -- though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm -- the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance . |	|But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle ; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside -LRB- which was very probable indeed -RRB- , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted ; which was very self-devotional . |	|Besides , the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm , and always sent the beadle the day before , to say they were going . |	1	Beadle									
0.855372461337455	141	|Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness , when , glancing upward , he caught sight of Mrs. Mann , who had got behind the beadle 's chair , and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance . |	|He took the hint at once , for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection . |	|` Will she go with me ?

0.905328760906155	203	|The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel ; and that frightened people . |	|For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed , the system was in full operation . |	|It was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker 's bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two 's gruel . |	1	Oliver Twist									
0.982031189811185	6	|There being nobody by , however , but a pauper old woman , who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer ; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract ; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them . |	|The result was , that , after a few struggles , Oliver breathed , sneezed , and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish , by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage , a voice , for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter . |	|As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs , the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead , rustled ; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow ; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words , ` Let me see the child , and die .

0.640780813795475	154	|Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind , they were the only friends he had ever known ; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world , sank into the child 's heart for the first time . |	|Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides ; little Oliver , firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff , trotted beside him , inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were ` nearly there . ' |	|To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies ; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated ; and he was once again a beadle . |	2	Mr. Bumble	Oliver Twist

0.38699726960271	50	|Sevenpence-halfpenny 's worth per week is a good round diet for a child ; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable . |	|The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience ; she knew what was good for children ; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself . |	|So , she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use , and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.067409799620098	39	|What an excellent example of the power of dress , young Oliver Twist was ! |	|Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering , he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar ; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society . |	|But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service , he was badged and ticketed , and fell into his place at once -- a parish child -- the orphan of a workhouse -- the humble , half-starved drudge -- to be cuffed and buffeted through the world -- despised by all , and pitied by none . |	1	Oliver Twist									
0.92641693397071	1	|CHAPTER I TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH Among other public buildings in a certain town , which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning , and to which I will assign no fictitious name , there is one anciently common to most towns , great or small : to wit , a workhouse ; and in this workhouse was born ; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat , inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader , in this stage of the business at all events ; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter . |	|For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble , by the parish surgeon , it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared ; or , if they had , that being comprised within a couple of pages , they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography , extant in the literature of any age or country . |	|Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred . |	0										
0.663632767274021	65	|` Goodness gracious ! |	|Is that you , Mr. Bumble , sir ? ' |	|said Mrs. Mann , thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy . ' |	1	Mr. Bumble

0.342155386686472	213	|He had a wild , hungry eye ; and they implicitly believed him . |	|A council was held ; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening , and ask for more ; and it fell to Oliver Twist . |	|The evening arrived ; the boys took their places . |	1	Oliver Twist									
0.473448224185056	201	|They made a great many other wise and humane regulations , having reference to the ladies , which it is not necessary to repeat ; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people , in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors ' Commons ; and , instead of compelling a man to support his family , as they had theretofore done , took his family away from him , and made him a bachelor ! |	|There is no saying how many applicants for relief , under these last two heads , might have started up in all classes of society , if it had not been coupled with the workhouse ; but the board were long-headed men , and had provided for this difficulty . |	|The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel ; and that frightened people . |	0										
0.12525590625158	241	|In other words , five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade , business , or calling .

0.62120634821999	156	|To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies ; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated ; and he was once again a beadle . |	|Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour , and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread , when Mr. Bumble , who had handed him over to the care of an old woman , returned ; and , telling him it was a board night , informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith . |	|Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was , Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence , and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry . |	2	Oliver Twist	Mr. Bumble								
0.463093052033316	220	|The master was a fat , healthy man ; but he turned very pale . |	|He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds , and then clung for support to the copper . |	|The assistants were paralysed with wonder ; the boys with fear . |	1	DEFAULT

0.38434227820522	277	|The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation ; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins . |	|The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes , but in so low a tone , that the words ` saving of expenditure , ' ` looked well in the accounts , ' ` have a printed report published , ' were alone audible . |	|These only chanced to be heard , indeed , or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis . |	0										
0.959344307114294	96	|` Now , just a leetle drop , ' said Mrs. Mann persuasively . |	|` What is it ? ' |	|inquired the beadle . |	0										
0.456243642762188	139	|` Will you go along with me , Oliver ?

0.716730628957514	36	|Ah ! |	|Good-night ! ' |	|The medical gentleman walked away to dinner ; and the nurse , having once more applied herself to the green bottle , sat down on a low chair before the fire , and proceeded to dress the infant . |	0

0.865061287133752	3	|Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred . |	|The fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration , -- a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence ; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next : the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter . |	|Now , if , during this brief period , Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers , anxious aunts , experienced nurses , and doctors of profound wisdom , he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time . |	1	Oliver Twist									
0.212295845620347	134	|So let me see him at once . ' |	|` I 'll fetch him directly , ' said Mrs. Mann , leaving the room for that purpose . |	|Oliver , having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands , removed , as could be scrubbed off in one washing , was led into the room by his benevolent protectress . |	2	Mrs. Mann	Oliver Twist								
0.105290969953659	106	|` No ' ; said Mr. Bumble approvingly ; ` no , you could not . |	|You are a humane woman , Mrs. Mann . ' |	|-LRB- Here she set down the glass . -RRB- ' |	1	Mrs. Mann

0.001170633034705	287	|` No , ' replied Mr. Limbkins ; ` at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered .

0.658398083596014	198	|said the board , looking very knowing ; ` we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . ' |	|So , they established the rule , that all poor people should have the alternative -LRB- for they would compel nobody , not they -RRB- , of being starved by a gradual process in the house , or by a quick one out of it . |	|With this view , they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water ; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal ; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day , with an onion twice a week , and half a roll of Sundays . |	0										
0.831725265815092	48	|The workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not . |	|Upon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that Oliver should be ` farmed , ' or , in other words , that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week . |	|Sevenpence-halfpenny 's worth per week is a good round diet for a child ; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable . |	1	Oliver Twist

0.068818021404013	164	|said the gentleman in the high chair . |	|Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen , which made him tremble : and the beadle gave him another tap behind , which made him cry . |	|These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice ; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool . |	1	Oliver Twist									
0.978306622236435	55	|Unfortunately for , the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of _ her _ system ; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half-smothered by accident ; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this . |	|Occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing -- though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm -- the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance . |	|But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle ; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside -LRB- which was very probable indeed -RRB- , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted ; which was very self-devotional . |	0

0.236081844626751	250	|As for exercise , it was nice cold weather , and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump , in a stone yard , in the presence of Mr. Bumble , who prevented his catching cold , and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame , by repeated applications of the cane . |	|As for society , he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined , and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example . |	|And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation , he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time , and there permitted to listen to , and console his mind with , a general supplication of the boys , containing a special clause , therein inserted by authority of the board , in which they entreated to be made good , virtuous , contented , and obedient , and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist : whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness , and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself . |	1	Oliver Twist
