0.257693302025032	100	|There he hesitated , for in his mind the Dip was already Jim 's and Roach required leave to descend it . |	|But Jim had disappeared into the caravan , so having waited a moment Roach stepped gingerly down the bank and offered the marble through the doorway . |	|Jim did n't spot him at once . |	2	Jim	Bill Roach

0.083593022352525	41	|But the money that came in was never quite enough to finance the ambition , so it was frittered away on other schemes , such as a new projector for the art school , and a plan to grow mushrooms in the school cellars . |	|And even , said the cruel ones , to feather a nest for certain illicit lovers when they eventually took flight to Germany , the lady 's native home . |	|Jim was unaware of these associations . |	0

0.087850534379653	249	|By the time he reached his study , however , Thursgood 's laughter had quite worn off and he became extremely nervous . |	|Bogus Oxford men he could deal with , just as in his time he had known classics masters who had no Greek and parsons who had no divinity . |	|Such men , confronted with proof of their deception , broke down and wept and left , or stayed on half pay . |	1	DEFAULT

0.605418555450152	1	|CHAPTER ONE The truth is , if old Major Dover had n't dropped dead at Taunton races Jim would never have come to Thursgood 's at all . |	|He came in mid-term without an interview , late May it was though no one would have thought it from the weather , employed through one of the shiftier agencies specialising in supply teachers for prep schools , to hold down old Dover 's teaching till someone suitable could be found . ' |	|A linguist , ' Thursgood told the common room , ' a temporary measure , ' and brushed away his forelock in self-defence . |	2	Jim	Major Dover								
0.732146420968295	297	|And when at last his mother 's chauffeur dropped him at the hated steps , he did not pause to say goodbye but ran for all he was worth to the top of the Dip , and there to his immeasurable joy was Jim 's caravan in its same spot at the bottom , a shade dirtier than before , and a fresh patch of earth beside it , he supposed for winter vegetables . |	|And Jim sitting on the step grinning up at him , as if he had heard Bill coming and got the grin of welcome ready before he appeared at the brink . |	|That same term , Jim invented a nickname for Roach . |	2	Jim	Bill Roach								
0.42267439123362	62	|Rising now , and turning his crooked back on Roach , Jim set to work on what appeared to be a detailed study of the caravan 's four legs , a very critical study which involved much rocking of the suspension , and much tilting of the strangely garbed head , and the emplacement of several bricks at different angles and points . |	|Meanwhile the spring rain was clattering down on everything : his coat , his hat and the roof of the old caravan . |	|And Roach noticed that throughout these manoeuvres Jim 's right shoulder had not budged at all but stayed wedged high against his neck like a rock under the mackintosh . |	1	Jim									
0.756676829636701	17	|Early afternoons at Thursgood 's are a tranquil time , a brief truce in the running fight of each school day . |	|The boys are sent to rest in their dormitories , the staff sit in the common room over coffee reading newspapers or correcting boys ' work . |	|Thursgood reads a novel to his mother . |	0										
0.646296636630598	55	|` Sir , Roach , sir . |	|I 'm a new boy . ' |	|For a moment longer , the brick face surveyed Roach from the shadow of the hat . |	1	Bill Roach									
0.617834853849535	133	|The only personal things he could find were a webbing kitbag hanging from the door , a set of sewing things stored beside the bunk and a homemade shower made from a perforated biscuit tin and neatly welded to the roof . |	|And on the table one bottle of colourless drink , gin or vodka , because that was what his father drank when Roach went to his flat for weekends in the holidays . |	|` East-west looks okay but north-south is undoubtedly skewwhiff , ' Jim declared , testing the other window ledge . |	1	Bill Roach									
0.063584925475247	185	|A moment later Roach felt the ground swaying under his feet and heard another roar either of pain or anger , as Jim wrestled with an off-side prop . |	|In the course of that same summer term , the boys paid Jim the compliment of a nickname . |	|They had several shots before they were happy . |	1	Jim									
0.363517857679234	216	|Going to bed they could glimpse his lonely shadow through the perspex roof of the fives court as the Rhino tirelessly attacked the concrete wall . |	|And sometimes on warm evenings from their dormitory windows they would covertly watch him at golf , which he played with a dreadful old iron , zigzag across the playing fields , often after reading to them from an extremely English adventure book : Biggles , Percy Westerman or Jeffrey Farnol , grabbed haphazard from the dingy library . |	|At each stroke they waited for the grunt as he started his backswing and they were seldom disappointed . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.432421785269001	298	|And Jim sitting on the step grinning up at him , as if he had heard Bill coming and got the grin of welcome ready before he appeared at the brink . |	|That same term , Jim invented a nickname for Roach . |	|He dropped Bill and called him Jumbo instead . |	2	Jim	Bill Roach								
0.618171366796187	288	|` He ca n't have been in prison all the time , ' said his mother after a very long silence , still without looking up from her sewing . |	|` He 's been somewhere , ' said Thursgood morosely , staring across the windswept gardens towards the Dip . |	|All through the summer holidays , as he moved uncomfortably between one household and another , embracing and rejecting , Bill Roach fretted about Jim , whether his back was hurting , what he was doing for money now that he had no one to teach and only half a term 's pay to live on ; worst of all whether he would be there when the new term began , for Bill had a feeling he could not describe that Jim lived so precariously on the world 's surface that he might at any time fall off into a void ; for he feared that Jim was like himself , without a natural gravity to hold him on . |	2	Jim	Mrs Thursgood								
0.966380527756701	78	|The unpaid Bill . |	|Anyone ever call you that ? ' |	|` No , sir . ' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.951909227165269	74	|Jim however made no response at all , so that Roach felt an odd stirring of kinship suddenly , and of hope . |	|` My other name 's Bill , ' he said . ' |	|I was christened Bill but Mr Thursgood calls me William . ' |	1	Bill Roach									
0.240696641072493	251	|Such men , confronted with proof of their deception , broke down and wept and left , or stayed on half pay . |	|But men who withheld genuine accomplishment , these were a breed he had not met but he knew already that he did not like them . |	|Having consulted the university calendar , he telephoned the agency , a Mr Stroll of the house of Stroll and Medley . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.802243879955339	71	|Older . |	|Got any friends ? ' |	|` No , sir , ' said Roach simply , in the listless tone which schoolboys always use for saying ` no ' , leaving all positive response to their interrogators . |	0										
0.189957559729605	56	|I 'm a new boy . ' |	|For a moment longer , the brick face surveyed Roach from the shadow of the hat . |	|Then , to his intense relief , its features relaxed into a wolfish grin , the left hand , still clapped over the right shoulder , resumed its slow massage while at the same time he managed a long pull from the plastic beaker . |	1	Bill Roach									
0.922273145768185	48	|The Alvis was in the stable yard ; Roach never knew how Jim spirited it out of the Dip , but the caravan was right down there , at what should have been the deep end , bedded on platforms of weathered brick , and Jim was sitting on the step drinking from a green plastic beaker , and rubbing his right shoulder as if he had banged it on something , while the rain poured off his hat . |	|Then the hat lifted and Roach found himself staring at an extremely fierce red face , made still fiercer by the shadow of the brim and by a brown moustache washed into fangs by the rain . |	|The rest of the face was criss-crossed with jagged cracks , so deep and crooked that Roach concluded in another of his flashes of imaginative genius that Jim had once been very hungry in a tropical place and filled up again since . |	1	Bill Roach									
0.35121616683471	97	|We did when I was at school . ' |	|Roach had no marble but Aprahamian had had a whole collection flown in from Beirut . |	|It took Roach about fifty seconds to race back to the school , secure one against the wildest undertakings and return panting to the Dip . |	2	Bill Roach	Aprahamian								
0.87042525494909	151	|Cheers . ' |	|Now this was an unfortunate question to ask of Roach just then for it occupied most of his waking hours . |	|Indeed he had recently come to doubt whether he had any purpose on earth at all . |	1	Bill Roach									
0.194212417439034	26	|In Roach 's observation Jim did not stop at the school buildings but continued across the sweep to the stable yard . |	|He knew the layout of the place already . |	|Roach decided later that he must have made a reconnaissance or studied maps . |	1	Bill Roach									
0.373051022870055	284	|Why did n't he finish ? |	|What went wrong ? ' ' |	|I seem to recall there was an interlude round about then , ' said Mr Stroll after another age . |	0										
0.931380080335339	264	|` He 's been in dock , ' Mr Stroll whispered on , as if through frightful draughts of cigarette smoke . |	|` Laid up . |	|Spinal . ' |	0

0.243034370264329	64	|And Roach noticed that throughout these manoeuvres Jim 's right shoulder had not budged at all but stayed wedged high against his neck like a rock under the mackintosh . |	|Therefore he wondered whether Jim was a sort of giant hunchback and whether all hunch backs hurt as Jim 's did . |	|And he noticed as a generality , a thing to store away , that people with bad backs take long strides , it was something to do with balance . |	1	Bill Roach	Jim								
0.379380675509802	124	|Laying the marble in it , Jim watched it roll to the end and fall on the floor . |	|` Skew-whiff , ' he repeated . |	|` Kipping in the stem . |	1	Jim

0.884209024603947	32	|The Dip is a piece of Thursgood folklore . |	|It lies in a patch of waste land between the orchard , the fruithouse and the stable yard . |	|To look at , it is no more than a depression in the ground , grass-covered , with hummocks on the northern side , each about boy-height and covered in tufted thickets which in summer grow spongy . |	0

0.156333072320071	239	|Only a gamekeeper , declared Sudeley , who had one , would know how to kill an owl so well . |	|Among the rest of the Thursgood community , opinion regarding Jim was less unanimous . |	|The ghost of Mr Maltby the pianist died hard . |	1	Jim

0.852702111847132	214	|Partly this was a play on Prideaux , partly a reference to his taste for living off the land and his appetite for physical exercise which they noted constantly . |	|Shivering in the shower queue first thing in the morning they would see the Rhino pounding down Combe Lane with a rucksack on his crooked back as he returned from his morning march . |	|Going to bed they could glimpse his lonely shadow through the perspex roof of the fives court as the Rhino tirelessly attacked the concrete wall . |	1	Jim Prideaux									
0.409740206103352	36	|They are the traces of an open-cast silver mine , says one year , and digs enthusiastically for wealth . |	|They are a Romano-British fort , says another , and stages battles with sticks and clay missiles . |	|To others the Dip is a bomb-crater from the war and the hummocks are seated bodies buried in the blast . |	0										
0.968744120520258	86	|Jim did not tell Roach to go away so Roach stayed on the brow peering downward through his rain-smeared spectacles . |	|The bricks , he noticed with awe , were pinched from the cucumber frame . |	|Several had been loose already and Jim must have loosened them a bit more . |	1	Bill Roach

0.175688929507624	87	|The bricks , he noticed with awe , were pinched from the cucumber frame . |	|Several had been loose already and Jim must have loosened them a bit more . |	|It seemed a wonderful thing to Roach that anyone just arrived at Thursgood 's should be so self-possessed as to pinch the actual fabric of the school for his own purposes , and doubly wonderful that Jim had run a lead off the hydrant for his water , for that hydrant was the subject of a special school rule : to touch it at all was a beatable offence . |	1	Jim									
0.244284394176876	104	|This sipping movement , Roach noticed , was actually quite difficult , for Jim could not easily swallow standing up straight , he had to tilt his whole twisted trunk backward to achieve the angle . |	|Meanwhile the rain came on really hard again , rattling against the caravan like gravel . |	|` Sir , ' said Roach but Jim made no move . |	0
