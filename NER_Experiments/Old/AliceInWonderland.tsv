|So she was considering in her own mind -LRB- as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid -RRB- , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her . |	Alice	White Rabbit								
|There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself , ` Oh dear ! |	Alice	White Rabbit								
|Oh dear ! |										
|I shall be late ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|-LRB- when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural -RRB- ; but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge . |	Alice	White Rabbit								
|In another moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again . |	Alice									
|The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well . |	Alice									
|Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next . |	Alice									
|First , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . |	DEFAULT									
|She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ` ORANGE MARMALADE ' , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it . |	DEFAULT									
|` Well ! ' |										
|thought Alice to herself , ` after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs ! |	Alice									
|How brave they 'll all think me at home ! |	Alice									
|Why , I would n't say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|-LRB- Which was very likely true . -RRB- |										
|Down , down , down . |										
|Would the fall NEVER come to an end ! |										
|` I wonder how many miles I 've fallen by this time ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|she said aloud . |	DEFAULT									
|` I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . |	Alice									
|Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think -- ' -LRB- for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over -RRB- ` -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ? ' |	Alice									
|-LRB- Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . -RRB- |	Alice									
|Presently she began again . |	Alice									
|` I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth ! |	DEFAULT									
|How funny it 'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward ! |										
|The Antipathies , I think -- ' -LRB- she was rather glad there WAS no one listening , this time , as it did n't sound at all the right word -RRB- ` -- but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know . |	DEFAULT									
|Please , Maâ€™am , is this New Zealand or Australia ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|-LRB- and she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you 're falling through the air ! |	DEFAULT									
|Do you think you could manage it ? -RRB- |	DEFAULT									
|` And what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking ! |	DEFAULT									
|No , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Down , down , down . |										
|There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again . |	Alice									
|` Dinah 'll miss me very much to-night , I should think ! ' |	Dinah	Alice								
|-LRB- Dinah was the cat . -RRB- |	Dinah									
|` I hope they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time . |	DEFAULT	Dinah								
|Dinah my dear ! |	Dinah									
|I wish you were down here with me ! |	Dinah	DEFAULT								
|There are no mice in the air , I 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|But do cats eat bats , I wonder ? ' |	Alice									
|And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , ` Do cats eat bats ? |	Alice									
|Do cats eat bats ? ' |										
|and sometimes , ` Do bats eat cats ? ' |										
|for , you see , as she could n't answer either question , it did n't much matter which way she put it . |	DEFAULT									
|She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ` Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? ' |	DEFAULT	Dinah								
|when suddenly , thump ! |										
|thump ! |										
|down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over . |	Alice									
|Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . |	Alice	White Rabbit								
|There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ` Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' |	Alice									
|She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . |	Alice	White Rabbit								
|There were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again . |	Alice									
|Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! |	Alice									
|either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . |										
|However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted ! |	Alice									
|Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . |	Alice									
|How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ` and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor Alice , ` it would be of very little use without my shoulders . |	Alice									
|Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! |	Alice									
|I think I could , if I only knew how to begin . ' |	Alice									
|For , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . |	Alice									
|There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , -LSB- ` which certainly was not here before , ' said Alice , -RRB- and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ` DRINK ME ' beautifully printed on it in large letters . |	Alice									
|It was all very well to say ` Drink me , ' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry . |	Alice									
|` No , I 'll look first , ' she said , ` and see whether it 's marked `` poison '' or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ` poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later . |	Alice									
|However , this bottle was NOT marked ` poison , ' so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , -LRB- it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , -RRB- she very soon finished it off . |	Alice									
|* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ` What a curious feeling ! ' |										
|said Alice ; ` I must be shutting up like a telescope . ' |	Alice									
|And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden . |	Alice									
|First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; ` for it might end , you know , ' said Alice to herself , ` in my going out altogether , like a candle . |	Alice									
|I wonder what I should be like then ? ' |	Alice									
|And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing . |	Alice									
|After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! |	DEFAULT									
|when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried . |	Alice									
|` Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! ' |										
|said Alice to herself , rather sharply ; ` I advise you to leave off this minute ! ' |	Alice									
|She generally gave herself very good advice , -LRB- though she very seldom followed it -RRB- , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people . |	Alice									
|` But it 's no use now , ' thought poor Alice , ` to pretend to be two people ! |	Alice									
|Why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person ! ' |	Alice									
|Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ` EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants . |	Alice									
|` Well , I 'll eat it , ' said Alice , ` and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I 'll get into the garden , and I do n't care which happens ! ' |	Alice									
|She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ` Which way ? |	Alice									
|Which way ? ' |										
|, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way . |	Alice									
|So she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake . |	Alice									
|* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II . |										
|The Pool of Tears ` Curiouser and curiouser ! ' |										
|cried Alice -LRB- she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English -RRB- ; ` now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! |	Alice									
|Good-bye , feet ! ' |										
|-LRB- for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off -RRB- . |	DEFAULT									
|` Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm sure _ I _ sha n't be able ! |	Alice									
|I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; -- but I must be kind to them , ' thought Alice , ` or perhaps they wo n't walk the way I want to go ! |	Alice									
|Let me see : I 'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas . ' |	Alice									
|And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it . |	DEFAULT									
|` They must go by the carrier , ' she thought ; ` and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one 's own feet ! |	DEFAULT									
|And how odd the directions will look ! |										
|ALICE 'S RIGHT FOOT , ESQ. . |	Alice									
|HEARTHRUG , NEAR THE FENDER , -LRB- WITH ALICE 'S LOVE -RRB- . |	Alice									
|Oh dear , what nonsense I 'm talking ! ' |	Alice									
|Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door . |	Alice									
|Poor Alice ! |	Alice									
|It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again . |	Alice									
|` You ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said Alice , ` a great girl like you , ' -LRB- she might well say this -RRB- , ` to go on crying in this way ! |	DEFAULT	Alice								
|Stop this moment , I tell you ! ' |	Alice									
|But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall . |	DEFAULT									
|After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . |	DEFAULT									
|It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ` Oh ! |	White Rabbit									
|the Duchess , the Duchess ! |										
|Oh ! |										
|wo n't she be savage if I 've kept her waiting ! ' |	Alice									
|Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ` If you please , sir -- ' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go . |	Alice	White Rabbit								
|Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : ` Dear , dear ! |	Alice									
|How queer everything is to-day ! |										
|And yesterday things went on just as usual . |										
|I wonder if I 've been changed in the night ? |	DEFAULT									
|Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? |										
|I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . |	DEFAULT									
|But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ? |	DEFAULT									
|Ah , THAT 'S the great puzzle ! ' |										
|And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them . |	DEFAULT									
|` I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , ' she said , ` for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n't be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh ! |	DEFAULT	Ada	Mabel							
|she knows such a very little ! |	Mabel									
|Besides , SHE 'S she , and I 'm I , and -- oh dear , how puzzling it all is ! |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I 'll try if I know all the things I used to know . |	DEFAULT									
|Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is -- oh dear ! |	DEFAULT									
|I shall never get to twenty at that rate ! |	DEFAULT									
|However , the Multiplication Table does n't signify : let 's try Geography . |										
|London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome -- no , THAT 'S all wrong , I 'm certain ! |	DEFAULT									
|I must have been changed for Mabel ! |	DEFAULT	Mabel								
|I 'll try and say `` How doth the little -- ``' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do : -- ` How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale ! |	DEFAULT									
|` How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|` I 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ` I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh ! |	Alice	Mabel								
|ever so many lessons to learn ! |										
|No , I 've made up my mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here ! |	DEFAULT	Mabel								
|It 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying `` Come up again , dear ! '' |										
|I shall only look up and say `` Who am I then ? |	DEFAULT									
|Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else '' -- but , oh dear ! ' |	Alice									
|cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ` I do wish they WOULD put their heads down ! |	Alice									
|I am so VERY tired of being all alone here ! ' |	Alice									
|As she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking . |	DEFAULT	White Rabbit								
|` How CAN I have done that ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|she thought . |	DEFAULT									
|` I must be growing small again . ' |	DEFAULT									
|She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether . |	DEFAULT									
|` That WAS a narrow escape ! ' |										
|said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ` and now for the garden ! ' |	Alice									
|and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas ! |	Alice									
|the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ` and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , ` for I never was so small as this before , never ! |	DEFAULT									
|And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! |	DEFAULT									
|she was up to her chin in salt water . |	DEFAULT									
|Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ` and in that case I can go back by railway , ' she said to herself . |	Alice									
|-LRB- Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . -RRB- |	Alice									
|However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . |	Alice									
|` I wish I had n't cried so much ! ' |	Alice									
|said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . |	Alice									
|` I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! |	Alice									
|That WILL be a queer thing , to be sure ! |										
|However , everything is queer to-day . ' |										
|Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself . |	Alice									
|` Would it be of any use , now , ' thought Alice , ` to speak to this mouse ? |	Alice									
|Everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . ' |	Alice									
|So she began : ` O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? |	DEFAULT	Mouse								
|I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! ' |	Alice	Mouse								
|-LRB- Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother 's Latin Grammar , ` A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse ! ' -RRB- |	Alice									
|The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing . |	Mouse	Alice								
|` Perhaps it does n't understand English , ' thought Alice ; ` I daresay it 's a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . ' |	Alice	William								
|-LRB- For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . -RRB- |	Alice									
|So she began again : ` Ou est ma chatte ? ' |	Alice									
|which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book . |										
|The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . |	Mouse									
|` Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' |	Alice	Mouse								
|cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings . |	Alice									
|` I quite forgot you did n't like cats . ' |	Alice	DEFAULT								
|` Not like cats ! ' |										
|cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice . |	Mouse									
|` Would YOU like cats if you were me ? ' |	Alice	Mouse								
|` Well , perhaps not , ' said Alice in a soothing tone : ` do n't be angry about it . |	Alice									
|And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . |	Alice	Dinah	DEFAULT							
|She is such a dear quiet thing , ' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ` and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she 's such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon ! ' |	Dinah	Alice	Mouse							
|cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended . |	Alice	Mouse								
|` We wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . ' |	DEFAULT	Mouse								
|` We indeed ! ' |										
|cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail . |	Mouse									
|` As if I would talk on such a subject ! |	Mouse									
|Our family always HATED cats : nasty , low , vulgar things ! |										
|Do n't let me hear the name again ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|` I wo n't indeed ! ' |	Alice									
|said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation . |	Alice									
|` Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ? ' |	Mouse									
|The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly : ` There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you ! |	Mouse	Alice								
|A little bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair ! |										
|And it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I ca n't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds ! |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ` I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! ' |	Alice									
|For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went . |	Alice	Mouse								
|So she called softly after it , ` Mouse dear ! |	DEFAULT	Mouse								
|Do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' |	Mouse									
|When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale -LRB- with passion , Alice thought -RRB- , and it said in a low trembling voice , ` Let us get to the shore , and then I 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . ' |	Mouse	Alice								
|It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures . |	Duck	Dodo	Lory	DEFAULT						
|Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore . |	Alice									
|CHAPTER III . |										
|A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank -- the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable . |										
|The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life . |	Alice									
|Indeed , she had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , ` I am older than you , and must know better ' ; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was , and , as the Lory positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to be said . |	Alice	Lory								
|At last the Mouse , who seemed to be a person of authority among them , called out , ` Sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! |	Mouse									
|I 'LL soon make you dry enough ! ' |	Mouse	DEFAULT								
|They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the Mouse in the middle . |	Mouse									
|Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon . |	Alice									
|` Ahem ! ' |										
|said the Mouse with an important air , ` are you all ready ? |	Mouse									
|This is the driest thing I know . |	Mouse									
|Silence all round , if you please ! |										
|`` William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest . |	William									
|Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria -- ``' ` Ugh ! ' |	Edwin	Morcar								
|said the Lory , with a shiver . |	Lory									
|` I beg your pardon ! ' |	Mouse	DEFAULT								
|said the Mouse , frowning , but very politely : ` Did you speak ? ' |	Mouse	DEFAULT								
|` Not I ! ' |	Lory									
|said the Lory hastily . |	Lory									
|` I thought you did , ' said the Mouse . |	Mouse	Lory								
|` -- I proceed . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable -- ``' ` Found WHAT ? ' |	Edwin	Morcar	Stigand							
|said the Duck . |	Duck									
|` Found IT , ' the Mouse replied rather crossly : ` of course you know what `` it '' means . ' |	Mouse	Duck								
|` I know what `` it '' means well enough , when I find a thing , ' said the Duck : ` it 's generally a frog or a worm . |	Duck									
|The question is , what did the archbishop find ? ' |										
|The Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , ``` -- found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown . |	Mouse	Edgar Atheling	William							
|William 's conduct at first was moderate . |	William									
|But the insolence of his Normans -- '' How are you getting on now , my dear ? ' |	William	Alice								
|it continued , turning to Alice as it spoke . |	Alice									
|` As wet as ever , ' said Alice in a melancholy tone : ` it does n't seem to dry me at all . ' |	Alice									
|` In that case , ' said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet , ` I move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies -- ' ` Speak English ! ' |	Dodo									
|said the Eaglet . |										
|` I do n't know the meaning of half those long words , and , what 's more , I do n't believe you do either ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds tittered audibly . |	DEFAULT									
|` What I was going to say , ' said the Dodo in an offended tone , ` was , that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race . ' |	Dodo									
|` What IS a Caucus-race ? ' |										
|said Alice ; not that she wanted much to know , but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak , and no one else seemed inclined to say anything . |	Alice	Dodo								
|` Why , ' said the Dodo , ` the best way to explain it is to do it . ' |	Dodo									
|-LRB- And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . -RRB- |	DEFAULT	Dodo								
|First it marked out a race-course , in a sort of circle , -LSB- ` the exact shape does n't matter , ' it said , -RRB- and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there . |										
|There was no ` One , two , three , and away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over . |										
|However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ` The race is over ! ' |	Dodo									
|and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , ` But who has won ? ' |										
|This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead -LRB- the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him -RRB- , while the rest waited in silence . |	Dodo									
|At last the Dodo said , ` EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes . ' |	Dodo									
|` But who is to give the prizes ? ' |										
|quite a chorus of voices asked . |										
|` Why , SHE , of course , ' said the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , ` Prizes ! |	Alice	Dodo								
|Prizes ! ' |										
|Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , -LRB- luckily the salt water had not got into it -RRB- , and handed them round as prizes . |	Alice									
|There was exactly one a-piece all round . |										
|` But she must have a prize herself , you know , ' said the Mouse . |	DEFAULT	Mouse								
|` Of course , ' the Dodo replied very gravely . |	Dodo									
|` What else have you got in your pocket ? ' |	Alice									
|he went on , turning to Alice . |	DEFAULT	Alice								
|` Only a thimble , ' said Alice sadly . |	Alice									
|` Hand it over here , ' said the Dodo . |	Dodo									
|Then they all crowded round her once more , while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying ` We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ' ; and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered . |	Dodo	Alice								
|Alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could . |	Alice									
|The next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back . |										
|However , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the Mouse to tell them something more . |	Mouse									
|` You promised to tell me your history , you know , ' said Alice , ` and why it is you hate -- C and D , ' she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again . |	Mouse	Alice								
|` Mine is a long and a sad tale ! ' |										
|said the Mouse , turning to Alice , and sighing . |	Mouse	Alice								
|` It IS a long tail , certainly , ' said Alice , looking down with wonder at the Mouse 's tail ; ` but why do you call it sad ? ' |	Alice	Mouse								
|And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this : -- ` Fury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , `` Let us both go to law : I will prosecute YOU . |	Alice	Mouse	Fury							
|-- Come , I 'll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning I 've nothing to do . '' |	Mouse									
|Said the mouse to the cur , `` Such a trial , dear Sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath . '' |	Mouse									
|`` I 'll be judge , I 'll be jury , '' Said cunning old Fury : `` I 'll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death . |	Fury									
|''' ` You are not attending ! ' |	Alice									
|said the Mouse to Alice severely . |	Mouse	Alice								
|` What are you thinking of ? ' |	Alice									
|` I beg your pardon , ' said Alice very humbly : ` you had got to the fifth bend , I think ? ' |	Alice	DEFAULT								
|` I had NOT ! ' |	Mouse									
|cried the Mouse , sharply and very angrily . |	Mouse									
|` A knot ! ' |										
|said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her . |	Alice									
|` Oh , do let me help to undo it ! ' |	Alice									
|` I shall do nothing of the sort , ' said the Mouse , getting up and walking away . |	Mouse									
|` You insult me by talking such nonsense ! ' |	Mouse	DEFAULT								
|` I did n't mean it ! ' |	Alice									
|pleaded poor Alice . |	Alice									
|` But you 're so easily offended , you know ! ' |	Mouse									
|The Mouse only growled in reply . |	Mouse									
|` Please come back and finish your story ! ' |	Mouse									
|Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , ` Yes , please do ! ' |	Alice									
|but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker . |	Mouse									
|` What a pity it would n't stay ! ' |										
|sighed the Lory , as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ` Ah , my dear ! |	Lory	DEFAULT								
|Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|` Hold your tongue , Ma ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|said the young Crab , a little snappishly . |	DEFAULT									
|` You 're enough to try the patience of an oyster ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|` I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do ! ' |	Alice	Dinah								
|said Alice aloud , addressing nobody in particular . |	Alice									
|` She 'd soon fetch it back ! ' |	Alice									
|` And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ? ' |	Dinah	Lory								
|said the Lory . |	Lory									
|Alice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet : ` Dinah 's our cat . |	Alice	Dinah								
|And she 's such a capital one for catching mice you ca n't think ! |	Dinah	DEFAULT								
|And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds ! |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|Why , she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party . |										
|Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking , ` I really must be getting home ; the night-air does n't suit my throat ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , ` Come away , my dears ! |	DEFAULT									
|It 's high time you were all in bed ! ' |										
|On various pretexts they all moved off , and Alice was soon left alone . |	Alice									
|` I wish I had n't mentioned Dinah ! ' |	DEFAULT	Dinah								
|she said to herself in a melancholy tone . |	DEFAULT									
|` Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I 'm sure she 's the best cat in the world ! |	Dinah									
|Oh , my dear Dinah ! |	DEFAULT	Dinah								
|I wonder if I shall ever see you any more ! ' |	Dinah	Alice								
|And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited . |	Alice									
|In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story . |	Alice	Mouse
