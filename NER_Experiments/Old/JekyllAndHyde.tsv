|At friendly meetings , and when the wine was to his taste , something eminently human beaconed from his eye ; something indeed which never found its way into his talk , but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face , but more often and loudly in the acts of his life . |	Mr. Utterson									
|He was austere with himself ; drank gin when he was alone , to mortify a taste for vintages ; and though he enjoyed the theatre , had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years . |	DEFAULT									
|But he had an approved tolerance for others ; sometimes wondering , almost with envy , at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds ; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I incline to Cain 's heresy , '' he used to say quaintly : `` I let my brother go to the devil in his own way . '' |	Cain	DEFAULT								
|In this character , it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men . |	DEFAULT									
|And to such as these , so long as they came about his chambers , he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour . |	Mr. Utterson									
|No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson ; for he was undemonstrative at the best , and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature . |	Mr. Utterson									
|It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity ; and that was the lawyer 's way . |										
|His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest ; his affections , like ivy , were the growth of time , they implied no aptness in the object . |	DEFAULT									
|Hence , no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield , his distant kinsman , the well-known man about town . |	DEFAULT	Mr. Enfield								
|It was a nut to crack for many , what these two could see in each other , or what subject they could find in common . |										
|It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks , that they said nothing , looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend . |										
|For all that , the two men put the greatest store by these excursions , counted them the chief jewel of each week , and not only set aside occasions of pleasure , but even resisted the calls of business , that they might enjoy them uninterrupted . |										
|It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London . |										
|The street was small and what is called quiet , but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays . |										
|The inhabitants were all doing well , it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still , and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry ; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation , like rows of smiling saleswomen . |										
|Even on Sunday , when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage , the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood , like a fire in a forest ; and with its freshly painted shutters , well-polished brasses , and general cleanliness and gaiety of note , instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger . |										
|Two doors from one corner , on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court ; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street . |										
|It was two storeys high ; showed no window , nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper ; and bore in every feature , the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence . |										
|The door , which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker , was blistered and distained . |										
|Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels ; children kept shop upon the steps ; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings ; and for close on a generation , no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages . |										
|Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street ; but when they came abreast of the entry , the former lifted up his cane and pointed . |	Mr. Enfield	DEFAULT								
|`` Did you ever remark that door ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|he asked ; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative . |	DEFAULT									
|`` It is connected in my mind , '' added he , `` with a very odd story . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Indeed ? '' |										
|said Mr. Utterson , with a slight change of voice , `` and what was that ? '' |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` Well , it was this way , '' returned Mr. Enfield : `` I was coming home from some place at the end of the world , about three oâ€™clock of a black winter morning , and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps . |	Mr. Enfield									
|Street after street and all the folks asleep -- street after street , all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church -- till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman . |	Mr. Enfield									
|All at once , I saw two figures : one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk , and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|Well , sir , the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner ; and then came the horrible part of the thing ; for the man trampled calmly over the child 's body and left her screaming on the ground . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It sounds nothing to hear , but it was hellish to see . |										
|It was n't like a man ; it was like some damned Juggernaut . |										
|I gave a few halloa , took to my heels , collared my gentleman , and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He was perfectly cool and made no resistance , but gave me one look , so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The people who had turned out were the girl 's own family ; and pretty soon , the doctor , for whom she had been sent put in his appearance . |	DEFAULT									
|Well , the child was not much the worse , more frightened , according to the Sawbones ; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it . |	DEFAULT									
|But there was one curious circumstance . |										
|I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight . |	DEFAULT									
|So had the child 's family , which was only natural . |										
|But the doctor 's case was what struck me . |										
|He was the usual cut and dry apothecary , of no particular age and colour , with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe . |	DEFAULT									
|Well , sir , he was like the rest of us ; every time he looked at my prisoner , I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him . |	Sawbones	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|I knew what was in his mind , just as he knew what was in mine ; and killing being out of the question , we did the next best . |	Sawbones	DEFAULT								
|We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other . |	DEFAULT									
|If he had any friends or any credit , we undertook that he should lose them . |	DEFAULT									
|And all the time , as we were pitching it in red hot , we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies . |	DEFAULT									
|I never saw a circle of such hateful faces ; and there was the man in the middle , with a kind of black sneering coolness -- frightened too , I could see that -- but carrying it off , sir , really like Satan . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` If you choose to make capital out of this accident , ' said he , ` I am naturally helpless . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene , ' says he . |	DEFAULT									
|` Name your figure . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Well , we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child 's family ; he would have clearly liked to stick out ; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief , and at last he struck . |	DEFAULT									
|The next thing was to get the money ; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|-- whipped out a key , went in , and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts 's , drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I ca n't mention , though it 's one of the points of my story , but it was a name at least very well known and often printed . |	DEFAULT									
|The figure was stiff ; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine . |										
|I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal , and that a man does not , in real life , walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man 's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|But he was quite easy and sneering . |	DEFAULT									
|` Set your mind at rest , ' says he , ` I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|So we all set off , the doctor , and the child 's father , and our friend and myself , and passed the rest of the night in my chambers ; and next day , when we had breakfasted , went in a body to the bank . |										
|I gave in the cheque myself , and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery . |	DEFAULT									
|Not a bit of it . |										
|The cheque was genuine . '' |										
|`` Tut-tut , '' said Mr. Utterson . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` I see you feel as I do , '' said Mr. Enfield . |	Mr. Enfield	Mr. Utterson								
|`` Yes , it 's a bad story . |										
|For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with , a really damnable man ; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties , celebrated too , and -LRB- what makes it worse -RRB- one of your fellows who do what they call good . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Black mail I suppose ; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door , in consequence . |	DEFAULT									
|Though even that , you know , is far from explaining all , '' he added , and with the words fell into a vein of musing . |	DEFAULT									
|From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly : `` And you do n't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there ? '' |	Mr. Utterson	DEFAULT								
|`` A likely place , is n't it ? '' |										
|returned Mr. Enfield . |	Mr. Enfield									
|`` But I happen to have noticed his address ; he lives in some square or other . '' |	Mr. Enfield	DEFAULT								
|`` And you never asked about the -- place with the door ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|said Mr. Utterson . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` No , sir : I had a delicacy , '' was the reply . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` I feel very strongly about putting questions ; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment . |	DEFAULT									
|You start a question , and it 's like starting a stone . |	DEFAULT									
|You sit quietly on the top of a hill ; and away the stone goes , starting others ; and presently some bland old bird -LRB- the last you would have thought of -RRB- is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name . |	DEFAULT									
|No sir , I make it a rule of mine : the more it looks like Queer Street , the less I ask . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` A very good rule , too , '' said the lawyer . |	Mr. Enfield									
|`` But I have studied the place for myself , '' continued Mr. Enfield . |	Mr. Enfield									
|`` It seems scarcely a house . |										
|There is no other door , and nobody goes in or out of that one but , once in a great while , the gentleman of my adventure . |										
|There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor ; none below ; the windows are always shut but they 're clean . |										
|And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking ; so somebody must live there . |										
|And yet it 's not so sure ; for the buildings are so packed together about the court , that it 's hard to say where one ends and another begins . '' |										
|The pair walked on again for a while in silence ; and then `` Enfield , '' said Mr. Utterson , `` that 's a good rule of yours . '' |	Mr. Enfield	Mr. Utterson								
|`` Yes , I think it is , '' returned Enfield . |	Mr. Enfield									
|`` But for all that , '' continued the lawyer , `` there 's one point I want to ask : I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Well , '' said Mr. Enfield , `` I ca n't see what harm it would do . |	Mr. Enfield									
|It was a man of the name of Hyde . '' |	Hyde									
|`` Hm , '' said Mr. Utterson . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` What sort of a man is he to see ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` He is not easy to describe . |	DEFAULT									
|There is something wrong with his appearance ; something displeasing , something down-right detestable . |	DEFAULT									
|I never saw a man I so disliked , and yet I scarce know why . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He must be deformed somewhere ; he gives a strong feeling of deformity , although I could n't specify the point . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He 's an extraordinary looking man , and yet I really can name nothing out of the way . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|No , sir ; I can make no hand of it ; I ca n't describe him . |	DEFAULT									
|And it 's not want of memory ; for I declare I can see him this moment . '' |	Mr. Utterson	DEFAULT								
|Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` You are sure he used a key ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|he inquired at last . |	DEFAULT									
|`` My dear sir ... '' began Enfield , surprised out of himself . |	Mr. Enfield	Mr. Utterson								
|`` Yes , I know , '' said Utterson ; `` I know it must seem strange . |	Mr. Utterson									
|The fact is , if I do not ask you the name of the other party , it is because I know it already . |	Mr. Utterson	Richard								
|You see , Richard , your tale has gone home . |	Richard									
|If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it . '' |	Richard									
|`` I think you might have warned me , '' returned the other with a touch of sullenness . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` But I have been pedantically exact , as you call it . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The fellow had a key ; and what 's more , he has it still . |	DEFAULT									
|I saw him use it not a week ago . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word ; and the young man presently resumed . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` Here is another lesson to say nothing , '' said he . |	Mr. Utterson									
|`` I am ashamed of my long tongue . |	DEFAULT									
|Let us make a bargain never to refer to this again . '' |										
|`` With all my heart , '' said the lawyer . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I shake hands on that , Richard . '' |	DEFAULT	Richard
