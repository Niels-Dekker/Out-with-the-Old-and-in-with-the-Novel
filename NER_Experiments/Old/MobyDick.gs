Some O
years O
ago O
-- O
never O
mind O
how O
long O
precisely O
-- O
having O
little O
or O
no O
money O
in O
my O
purse O
, O
and O
nothing O
particular O
to O
interest O
me O
on O
shore O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
sail O
about O
a O
little O
and O
see O
the O
watery O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O
It O
is O
a O
way O
I O
have O
of O
driving O
off O
the O
spleen O
and O
regulating O
the O
circulation O
. O
Whenever O
I O
find O
myself O
growing O
grim O
about O
the O
mouth O
; O
whenever O
it O
is O
a O
damp O
, O
drizzly O
November O
in O
my O
soul O
; O
whenever O
I O
find O
myself O
involuntarily O
pausing O
before O
coffin O
warehouses O
, O
and O
bringing O
up O
the O
rear O
of O
every O
funeral O
I O
meet O
; O
and O
especially O
whenever O
my O
hypos O
get O
such O
an O
upper O
hand O
of O
me O
, O
that O
it O
requires O
a O
strong O
moral O
principle O
to O
prevent O
me O
from O
deliberately O
stepping O
into O
the O
street O
, O
and O
methodically O
knocking O
people O
's O
hats O
off O
-- O
then O
, O
I O
account O
it O
high O
time O
to O
get O
to O
sea O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
. O
This O
is O
my O
substitute O
for O
pistol O
and O
ball O

With O
a O
philosophical O
flourish O
Cato I-PERSON
throws O
himself O
upon O
his O
sword O
; O
I O
quietly O
take O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
surprising O
in O
this O
. O
If O
they O
but O
knew O
it O
, O
almost O
all O
men O
in O
their O
degree O
, O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
cherish O
very O
nearly O
the O
same O
feelings O
towards O
the O
ocean O
with O
me O
. O
There O
now O
is O
your O
insular O
city O
of O
the O
Manhattoes O
, O
belted O
round O
by O
wharves O
as O
Indian O
isles O
by O
coral O
reefs O
-- O
commerce O
surrounds O
it O
with O
her O
surf O
. O
Right O
and O
left O
, O
the O
streets O
take O
you O
waterward O
. O
Its O
extreme O
downtown O
is O
the O
battery O
, O
where O
that O
noble O
mole O
is O
washed O
by O
waves O
, O
and O
cooled O
by O
breezes O
, O
which O
a O
few O
hours O
previous O
were O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
. O
Look O
at O
the O
crowds O
of O
water-gazers O
there O
. O
Circumambulate O
the O
city O
of O
a O
dreamy O
Sabbath O
afternoon O

Go O
from O
Corlears O
Hook O
to O
Coenties O
Slip O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
, O
by O
Whitehall O
, O
northward O
. O
What O
do O
you O
see O
? O
-- O
Posted O
like O
silent O
sentinels O
all O
around O
the O
town O
, O
stand O
thousands O
upon O
thousands O
of O
mortal O
men O
fixed O
in O
ocean O
reveries O
. O
Some O
leaning O
against O
the O
spiles O
; O
some O
seated O
upon O
the O
pier-heads O
; O
some O
looking O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
of O
ships O
from O
China O
; O
some O
high O
aloft O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
as O
if O
striving O
to O
get O
a O
still O
better O
seaward O
peep O
. O
But O
these O
are O
all O
landsmen O
; O
of O
week O
days O
pent O
up O
in O
lath O
and O
plaster O
-- O
tied O
to O
counters O
, O
nailed O
to O
benches O
, O
clinched O
to O
desks O
. O
How O
then O
is O
this O
? O
Are O
the O
green O
fields O
gone O
? O
What O
do O
they O
here O
? O
But O
look O
! O
here O
come O
more O
crowds O
, O
pacing O
straight O
for O
the O
water O
, O
and O
seemingly O
bound O
for O
a O
dive O
. O
Strange O
! O
Nothing O
will O
content O
them O
but O
the O
extremest O
limit O
of O
the O
land O
; O
loitering O
under O
the O
shady O
lee O
of O
yonder O
warehouses O
will O
not O
suffice O
. O
No O
. O
They O
must O
get O
just O
as O
nigh O
the O
water O
as O
they O
possibly O
can O
without O
falling O
in O
. O
And O
there O
they O
stand O
-- O
miles O
of O
them O
-- O
leagues O
. O
Inlanders O
all O
, O
they O
come O
from O
lanes O
and O
alleys O
, O
streets O
and O
avenues O
-- O
north O
, O
east O
, O
south O
, O
and O
west O
. O
Yet O
here O
they O
all O
unite O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
does O
the O
magnetic O
virtue O
of O
the O
needles O
of O
the O
compasses O
of O
all O
those O
ships O
attract O
them O
thither O
? O
Once O
more O
. O
Say O
you O
are O
in O
the O
country O
; O
in O
some O
high O
land O
of O
lakes O
. O
Take O
almost O
any O
path O
you O
please O
, O
and O
ten O
to O
one O
it O
carries O
you O
down O
in O
a O
dale O
, O
and O
leaves O
you O
there O
by O
a O
pool O
in O
the O
stream O
. O
There O
is O
magic O
in O
it O
. O
Let O
the O
most O
absent-minded O
of O
men O
be O
plunged O
in O
his O
deepest O
reveries O
-- O
stand O
that O
man O
on O
his O
legs O
, O
set O
his O
feet O
a-going O
, O
and O
he O
will O
infallibly O
lead O
you O
to O
water O
, O
if O
water O
there O
be O
in O
all O
that O
region O
. O
Should O
you O
ever O
be O
athirst O
in O
the O
great O
American O
desert O
, O
try O
this O
experiment O
, O
if O
your O
caravan O
happen O
to O
be O
supplied O
with O
a O
metaphysical O
professor O
. O
Yes O
, O
as O
every O
one O
knows O
, O
meditation O
and O
water O
are O
wedded O
for O
ever O
. O
But O
here O
is O
an O
artist O
. O
He O
desires O
to O
paint O
you O
the O
dreamiest O
, O
shadiest O
, O
quietest O
, O
most O
enchanting O
bit O
of O
romantic O
landscape O
in O
all O
the O
valley O
of O
the O
Saco O
. O
What O
is O
the O
chief O
element O
he O
employs O
? O
There O
stand O
his O
trees O
, O
each O
with O
a O
hollow O
trunk O
, O
as O
if O
a O
hermit O
and O
a O
crucifix O
were O
within O
; O
and O
here O
sleeps O
his O
meadow O
, O
and O
there O
sleep O
his O
cattle O
; O
and O
up O
from O
yonder O
cottage O
goes O
a O
sleepy O
smoke O
. O
Deep O
into O
distant O
woodlands O
winds O
a O
mazy O
way O
, O
reaching O
to O
overlapping O
spurs O
of O
mountains O
bathed O
in O
their O
hill-side O
blue O
. O
But O
though O
the O
picture O
lies O
thus O
tranced O
, O
and O
though O
this O
pine-tree O
shakes O
down O
its O
sighs O
like O
leaves O
upon O
this O
shepherd O
's O
head O
, O
yet O
all O
were O
vain O
, O
unless O
the O
shepherd O
's O
eye O
were O
fixed O
upon O
the O
magic O
stream O
before O
him O
. O
Go O
visit O
the O
Prairies O
in O
June O
, O
when O
for O
scores O
on O
scores O
of O
miles O
you O
wade O
knee-deep O
among O
Tiger-lilies O
-- O
what O
is O
the O
one O
charm O
wanting O
? O
-- O
Water O
-- O
there O
is O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
there O
! O
Were O
Niagara O
but O
a O
cataract O
of O
sand O
, O
would O
you O
travel O
your O
thousand O
miles O
to O
see O
it O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
poor O
poet O
of O
Tennessee O
, O
upon O
suddenly O
receiving O
two O
handfuls O
of O
silver O
, O
deliberate O
whether O
to O
buy O
him O
a O
coat O
, O
which O
he O
sadly O
needed O
, O
or O
invest O
his O
money O
in O
a O
pedestrian O
trip O
to O
Rockaway O
Beach O
? O
Why O
is O
almost O
every O
robust O
healthy O
boy O
with O
a O
robust O
healthy O
soul O
in O
him O
, O
at O
some O
time O
or O
other O
crazy O
to O
go O
to O
sea O
? O
Why O
upon O
your O
first O
voyage O
as O
a O
passenger O
, O
did O
you O
yourself O
feel O
such O
a O
mystical O
vibration O
, O
when O
first O
told O
that O
you O
and O
your O
ship O
were O
now O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
old O
Persians O
hold O
the O
sea O
holy O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
Greeks O
give O
it O
a O
separate O
deity O
, O
and O
own O
brother O
of O
Jove I-PERSON
? O
Surely O
all O
this O
is O
not O
without O
meaning O
. O
And O
still O
deeper O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
story O
of O
Narcissus O
, O
who O
because O
he O
could O
not O
grasp O
the O
tormenting O
, O
mild O
image O
he O
saw O
in O
the O
fountain O
, O
plunged O
into O
it O
and O
was O
drowned O
. O
But O
that O
same O
image O
, O
we O
ourselves O
see O
in O
all O
rivers O
and O
oceans O
. O
It O
is O
the O
image O
of O
the O
ungraspable O
phantom O
of O
life O
; O
and O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
it O
all O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
going O
to O
sea O
whenever O
I O
begin O
to O
grow O
hazy O
about O
the O
eyes O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
be O
over O
conscious O
of O
my O
lungs O
, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
have O
it O
inferred O
that O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
passenger O
. O
For O
to O
go O
as O
a O
passenger O
you O
must O
needs O
have O
a O
purse O
, O
and O
a O
purse O
is O
but O
a O
rag O
unless O
you O
have O
something O
in O
it O
. O
Besides O
, O
passengers O
get O
sea-sick O
-- O
grow O
quarrelsome O
-- O
do O
n't O
sleep O
of O
nights O
-- O
do O
not O
enjoy O
themselves O
much O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
; O
-- O
no O
, O
I O
never O
go O
as O
a O
passenger O
; O
nor O
, O
though O
I O
am O
something O
of O
a O
salt O
, O
do O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
Commodore O
, O
or O
a O
Captain O
, O
or O
a O
Cook O
. O
I O
abandon O
the O
glory O
and O
distinction O
of O
such O
offices O
to O
those O
who O
like O
them O
. O
For O
my O
part O
, O
I O
abominate O
all O
honourable O
respectable O
toils O
, O
trials O
, O
and O
tribulations O
of O
every O
kind O
whatsoever O
. O
It O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
do O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
, O
without O
taking O
care O
of O
ships O
, O
barques O
, O
brigs O
, O
schooners O
, O
and O
what O
not O
. O
And O
as O
for O
going O
as O
cook O
, O
-- O
though O
I O
confess O
there O
is O
considerable O
glory O
in O
that O
, O
a O
cook O
being O
a O
sort O
of O
officer O
on O
ship-board O
-- O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
I O
never O
fancied O
broiling O
fowls O
; O
-- O
though O
once O
broiled O
, O
judiciously O
buttered O
, O
and O
judgmatically O
salted O
and O
peppered O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
will O
speak O
more O
respectfully O
, O
not O
to O
say O
reverentially O
, O
of O
a O
broiled O
fowl O
than O
I O
will O
. O
It O
is O
out O
of O
the O
idolatrous O
dotings O
of O
the O
old O
Egyptians O
upon O
broiled O
ibis O
and O
roasted O
river O
horse O
, O
that O
you O
see O
the O
mummies O
of O
those O
creatures O
in O
their O
huge O
bake-houses O
the O
pyramids O
. O
No O
, O
when O
I O
go O
to O
sea O
, O
I O
go O
as O
a O
simple O
sailor O
, O
right O
before O
the O
mast O
, O
plumb O
down O
into O
the O
forecastle O
, O
aloft O
there O
to O
the O
royal O
mast-head O
. O
True O
, O
they O
rather O
order O
me O
about O
some O
, O
and O
make O
me O
jump O
from O
spar O
to O
spar O
, O
like O
a O
grasshopper O
in O
a O
May O
meadow O
. O
And O
at O
first O
, O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
unpleasant O
enough O
. O
It O
touches O
one O
's O
sense O
of O
honour O
, O
particularly O
if O
you O
come O
of O
an O
old O
established O
family O
in O
the O
land O
, O
the O
Van O
Rensselaers O
, O
or O
Randolphs O
, O
or O
Hardicanutes O
. O
And O
more O
than O
all O
, O
if O
just O
previous O
to O
putting O
your O
hand O
into O
the O
tar-pot O
, O
you O
have O
been O
lording O
it O
as O
a O
country O
schoolmaster O
, O
making O
the O
tallest O
boys O
stand O
in O
awe O
of O
you O
. O
The O
transition O
is O
a O
keen O
one O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
from O
a O
schoolmaster O
to O
a O
sailor O
, O
and O
requires O
a O
strong O
decoction O
of O
Seneca O
and O
the O
Stoics O
to O
enable O
you O
to O
grin O
and O
bear O
it O
. O
But O
even O
this O
wears O
off O
in O
time O
. O
What O
of O
it O
, O
if O
some O
old O
hunks O
of O
a O
sea-captain O
orders O
me O
to O
get O
a O
broom O
and O
sweep O
down O
the O
decks O
? O
What O
does O
that O
indignity O
amount O
to O
, O
weighed O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
in O
the O
scales O
of O
the O
New O
Testament O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
the O
archangel O
Gabriel O
thinks O
anything O
the O
less O
of O
me O
, O
because O
I O
promptly O
and O
respectfully O
obey O
that O
old O
hunks O
in O
that O
particular O
instance O
? O
Who O
ai O
n't O
a O
slave O
? O
Tell O
me O
that O
. O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
however O
the O
old O
sea-captains O
may O
order O
me O
about O
-- O
however O
they O
may O
thump O
and O
punch O
me O
about O
, O
I O
have O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
knowing O
that O
it O
is O
all O
right O
; O
that O
everybody O
else O
is O
one O
way O
or O
other O
served O
in O
much O
the O
same O
way O
-- O
either O
in O
a O
physical O
or O
metaphysical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
that O
is O
; O
and O
so O
the O
universal O
thump O
is O
passed O
round O
, O
and O
all O
hands O
should O
rub O
each O
other O
's O
shoulder-blades O
, O
and O
be O
content O
. O
Again O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
sailor O
, O
because O
they O
make O
a O
point O
of O
paying O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
, O
whereas O
they O
never O
pay O
passengers O
a O
single O
penny O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
passengers O
themselves O
must O
pay O
. O
And O
there O
is O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
world O
between O
paying O
and O
being O
paid O
. O
The O
act O
of O
paying O
is O
perhaps O
the O
most O
uncomfortable O
infliction O
that O
the O
two O
orchard O
thieves O
entailed O
upon O
us O
. O
But O
being O
paid O
, O
-- O
what O
will O
compare O
with O
it O
? O
The O
urbane O
activity O
with O
which O
a O
man O
receives O
money O
is O
really O
marvellous O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
so O
earnestly O
believe O
money O
to O
be O
the O
root O
of O
all O
earthly O
ills O
, O
and O
that O
on O
no O
account O
can O
a O
monied O
man O
enter O
heaven O
. O
Ah O
! O
how O
cheerfully O
we O
consign O
ourselves O
to O
perdition O
! O
Finally O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
sailor O
, O
because O
of O
the O
wholesome O
exercise O
and O
pure O
air O
of O
the O
fore-castle O
deck O
. O
For O
as O
in O
this O
world O
, O
head O
winds O
are O
far O
more O
prevalent O
than O
winds O
from O
astern O
-LRB- O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O
never O
violate O
the O
Pythagorean O
maxim O
-RRB- O
, O
so O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
Commodore O
on O
the O
quarter-deck O
gets O
his O
atmosphere O
at O
second O
hand O
from O
the O
sailors O
on O
the O
forecastle O
. O
He O
thinks O
he O
breathes O
it O
first O
; O
but O
not O
so O
. O
In O
much O
the O
same O
way O
do O
the O
commonalty O
lead O
their O
leaders O
in O
many O
other O
things O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
the O
leaders O
little O
suspect O
it O
. O
But O
wherefore O
it O
was O
that O
after O
having O
repeatedly O
smelt O
the O
sea O
as O
a O
merchant O
sailor O
, O
I O
should O
now O
take O
it O
into O
my O
head O
to O
go O
on O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
; O
this O
the O
invisible O
police O
officer O
of O
the O
Fates O
, O
who O
has O
the O
constant O
surveillance O
of O
me O
, O
and O
secretly O
dogs O
me O
, O
and O
influences O
me O
in O
some O
unaccountable O
way O
-- O
he O
can O
better O
answer O
than O
any O
one O
else O
. O
And O
, O
doubtless O
, O
my O
going O
on O
this O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
formed O
part O
of O
the O
grand O
programme O
of O
Providence O
that O
was O
drawn O
up O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O
It O
came O
in O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
brief O
interlude O
and O
solo O
between O
more O
extensive O
performances O
. O
I O
take O
it O
that O
this O
part O
of O
the O
bill O
must O
have O
run O
something O
like O
this O
: O
`` O
Grand O
Contested O
Election O
for O
the O
Presidency O
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O
`` O
WHALING O
VOYAGE O
BY O
ONE O
ISHMAEL O
. O
`` O
BLOODY O
BATTLE O
IN O
AFFGHANISTAN O
. O
'' O
Though O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
why O
it O
was O
exactly O
that O
those O
stage O
managers O
, O
the O
Fates O
, O
put O
me O
down O
for O
this O
shabby O
part O
of O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
when O
others O
were O
set O
down O
for O
magnificent O
parts O
in O
high O
tragedies O
, O
and O
short O
and O
easy O
parts O
in O
genteel O
comedies O
, O
and O
jolly O
parts O
in O
farces O
-- O
though O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
why O
this O
was O
exactly O
; O
yet O
, O
now O
that O
I O
recall O
all O
the O
circumstances O
, O
I O
think O
I O
can O
see O
a O
little O
into O
the O
springs O
and O
motives O
which O
being O
cunningly O
presented O
to O
me O
under O
various O
disguises O
, O
induced O
me O
to O
set O
about O
performing O
the O
part O
I O
did O
, O
besides O
cajoling O
me O
into O
the O
delusion O
that O
it O
was O
a O
choice O
resulting O
from O
my O
own O
unbiased O
freewill O
and O
discriminating O
judgment O
. O
Chief O
among O
these O
motives O
was O
the O
overwhelming O
idea O
of O
the O
great O
whale O
himself O
. O
Such O
a O
portentous O
and O
mysterious O
monster O
roused O
all O
my O
curiosity O
. O
Then O
the O
wild O
and O
distant O
seas O
where O
he O
rolled O
his O
island O
bulk O
; O
the O
undeliverable O
, O
nameless O
perils O
of O
the O
whale O
; O
these O
, O
with O
all O
the O
attending O
marvels O
of O
a O
thousand O
Patagonian O
sights O
and O
sounds O
, O
helped O
to O
sway O
me O
to O
my O
wish O
. O
With O
other O
men O
, O
perhaps O
, O
such O
things O
would O
not O
have O
been O
inducements O
; O
but O
as O
for O
me O
, O
I O
am O
tormented O
with O
an O
everlasting O
itch O
for O
things O
remote O
. O
I O
love O
to O
sail O
forbidden O
seas O
, O
and O
land O
on O
barbarous O
coasts O
. O
Not O
ignoring O
what O
is O
good O
, O
I O
am O
quick O
to O
perceive O
a O
horror O
, O
and O
could O
still O
be O
social O
with O
it O
-- O
would O
they O
let O
me O
-- O
since O
it O
is O
but O
well O
to O
be O
on O
friendly O
terms O
with O
all O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O
place O
one O
lodges O
in O
. O
By O
reason O
of O
these O
things O
, O
then O
, O
the O
whaling O
voyage O
was O
welcome O
; O
the O
great O
flood-gates O
of O
the O
wonder-world O
swung O
open O
, O
and O
in O
the O
wild O
conceits O
that O
swayed O
me O
to O
my O
purpose O
, O
two O
and O
two O
there O
floated O
into O
my O
inmost O
soul O
, O
endless O
processions O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
and O
, O
mid O
most O
of O
them O
all O
, O
one O
grand O
hooded O
phantom O
, O
like O
a O
snow O
hill O
in O
the O
air O

CHAPTER O
2 O
. O
The O
Carpet-Bag O
. O
I O
stuffed O
a O
shirt O
or O
two O
into O
my O
old O
carpet-bag O
, O
tucked O
it O
under O
my O
arm O
, O
and O
started O
for O
Cape O
Horn O
and O
the O
Pacific O
. O
Quitting O
the O
good O
city O
of O
old O
Manhatto O
, O
I O
duly O
arrived O
in O
New O
Bedford O
. O
It O
was O
a O
Saturday O
night O
in O
December O
. O
Much O
was O
I O
disappointed O
upon O
learning O
that O
the O
little O
packet O
for O
Nantucket O
had O
already O
sailed O
, O
and O
that O
no O
way O
of O
reaching O
that O
place O
would O
offer O
, O
till O
the O
following O
Monday O
. O
As O
most O
young O
candidates O
for O
the O
pains O
and O
penalties O
of O
whaling O
stop O
at O
this O
same O
New O
Bedford O
, O
thence O
to O
embark O
on O
their O
voyage O
, O
it O
may O
as O
well O
be O
related O
that O
I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
so O
doing O
. O
For O
my O
mind O
was O
made O
up O
to O
sail O
in O
no O
other O
than O
a O
Nantucket O
craft O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
fine O
, O
boisterous O
something O
about O
everything O
connected O
with O
that O
famous O
old O
island O
, O
which O
amazingly O
pleased O
me O
. O
Besides O
though O
New O
Bedford O
has O
of O
late O
been O
gradually O
monopolising O
the O
business O
of O
whaling O
, O
and O
though O
in O
this O
matter O
poor O
old O
Nantucket O
is O
now O
much O
behind O
her O
, O
yet O
Nantucket O
was O
her O
great O
original O
-- O
the O
Tyre O
of O
this O
Carthage O
; O
-- O
the O
place O
where O
the O
first O
dead O
American O
whale O
was O
stranded O
. O
Where O
else O
but O
from O
Nantucket O
did O
those O
aboriginal O
whalemen O
, O
the O
Red-Men O
, O
first O
sally O
out O
in O
canoes O
to O
give O
chase O
to O
the O
Leviathan O
? O
And O
where O
but O
from O
Nantucket O
, O
too O
, O
did O
that O
first O
adventurous O
little O
sloop O
put O
forth O
, O
partly O
laden O
with O
imported O
cobblestones O
-- O
so O
goes O
the O
story O
-- O
to O
throw O
at O
the O
whales O
, O
in O
order O
to O
discover O
when O
they O
were O
nigh O
enough O
to O
risk O
a O
harpoon O
from O
the O
bowsprit O
? O
Now O
having O
a O
night O
, O
a O
day O
, O
and O
still O
another O
night O
following O
before O
me O
in O
New O
Bedford O
, O
ere O
I O
could O
embark O
for O
my O
destined O
port O
, O
it O
became O
a O
matter O
of O
concernment O
where O
I O
was O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
meanwhile O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
dubious-looking O
, O
nay O
, O
a O
very O
dark O
and O
dismal O
night O
, O
bitingly O
cold O
and O
cheerless O
. O
I O
knew O
no O
one O
in O
the O
place O
. O
With O
anxious O
grapnels O
I O
had O
sounded O
my O
pocket O
, O
and O
only O
brought O
up O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
silver O
, O
-- O
So O
, O
wherever O
you O
go O
, O
Ishmael I-PERSON
, O
said O
I O
to O
myself O
, O
as O
I O
stood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
dreary O
street O
shouldering O
my O
bag O
, O
and O
comparing O
the O
gloom O
towards O
the O
north O
with O
the O
darkness O
towards O
the O
south O
-- O
wherever O
in O
your O
wisdom O
you O
may O
conclude O
to O
lodge O
for O
the O
night O
, O
my O
dear O
Ishmael I-PERSON
, O
be O
sure O
to O
inquire O
the O
price O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
be O
too O
particular O
. O
With O
halting O
steps O
I O
paced O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
passed O
the O
sign O
of O
`` O
The O
Crossed O
Harpoons O
'' O
-- O
but O
it O
looked O
too O
expensive O
and O
jolly O
there O
. O
Further O
on O
, O
from O
the O
bright O
red O
windows O
of O
the O
`` O
Sword-Fish O
Inn O
, O
'' O
there O
came O
such O
fervent O
rays O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
have O
melted O
the O
packed O
snow O
and O
ice O
from O
before O
the O
house O
, O
for O
everywhere O
else O
the O
congealed O
frost O
lay O
ten O
inches O
thick O
in O
a O
hard O
, O
asphaltic O
pavement O
, O
-- O
rather O
weary O
for O
me O
, O
when O
I O
struck O
my O
foot O
against O
the O
flinty O
projections O
, O
because O
from O
hard O
, O
remorseless O
service O
the O
soles O
of O
my O
boots O
were O
in O
a O
most O
miserable O
plight O
. O
Too O
expensive O
and O
jolly O
, O
again O
thought O
I O
, O
pausing O
one O
moment O
to O
watch O
the O
broad O
glare O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
hear O
the O
sounds O
of O
the O
tinkling O
glasses O
within O
. O
But O
go O
on O
, O
Ishmael I-PERSON
, O
said O
I O
at O
last O
; O
do O
n't O
you O
hear O
? O
get O
away O
from O
before O
the O
door O
; O
your O
patched O
boots O
are O
stopping O
the O
way O
. O
So O
on O
I O
went O
. O
I O
now O
by O
instinct O
followed O
the O
streets O
that O
took O
me O
waterward O
, O
for O
there O
, O
doubtless O
, O
were O
the O
cheapest O
, O
if O
not O
the O
cheeriest O
inns O
. O
Such O
dreary O
streets O
! O
blocks O
of O
blackness O
, O
not O
houses O
, O
on O
either O
hand O
, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
a O
candle O
, O
like O
a O
candle O
moving O
about O
in O
a O
tomb O
. O
At O
this O
hour O
of O
the O
night O
, O
of O
the O
last O
day O
of O
the O
week O
, O
that O
quarter O
of O
the O
town O
proved O
all O
but O
deserted O
. O
But O
presently O
I O
came O
to O
a O
smoky O
light O
proceeding O
from O
a O
low O
, O
wide O
building O
, O
the O
door O
of O
which O
stood O
invitingly O
open O
. O
It O
had O
a O
careless O
look O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
meant O
for O
the O
uses O
of O
the O
public O
; O
so O
, O
entering O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
to O
stumble O
over O
an O
ash-box O
in O
the O
porch O
. O
Ha O
! O
thought O
I O
, O
ha O
, O
as O
the O
flying O
particles O
almost O
choked O
me O
, O
are O
these O
ashes O
from O
that O
destroyed O
city O
, O
Gomorrah O
? O
But O
`` O
The O
Crossed O
Harpoons O
, O
'' O
and O
`` O
The O
Sword-Fish O
? O
'' O
-- O
this O
, O
then O
must O
needs O
be O
the O
sign O
of O
`` O
The O
Trap O
. O
'' O
However O
, O
I O
picked O
myself O
up O
and O
hearing O
a O
loud O
voice O
within O
, O
pushed O
on O
and O
opened O
a O
second O
, O
interior O
door O
. O
It O
seemed O
the O
great O
Black O
Parliament O
sitting O
in O
Tophet O
. O
A O
hundred O
black O
faces O
turned O
round O
in O
their O
rows O
to O
peer O
; O
and O
beyond O
, O
a O
black O
Angel O
of O
Doom O
was O
beating O
a O
book O
in O
a O
pulpit O
. O
It O
was O
a O
negro O
church O
; O
and O
the O
preacher O
's O
text O
was O
about O
the O
blackness O
of O
darkness O
, O
and O
the O
weeping O
and O
wailing O
and O
teeth-gnashing O
there O
. O
Ha O
, O
Ishmael I-PERSON
, O
muttered O
I O
, O
backing O
out O
, O
Wretched O
entertainment O
at O
the O
sign O
of O
` O
The O
Trap O
! O
' O
Moving O
on O
, O
I O
at O
last O
came O
to O
a O
dim O
sort O
of O
light O
not O
far O
from O
the O
docks O
, O
and O
heard O
a O
forlorn O
creaking O
in O
the O
air O
; O
and O
looking O
up O
, O
saw O
a O
swinging O
sign O
over O
the O
door O
with O
a O
white O
painting O
upon O
it O
, O
faintly O
representing O
a O
tall O
straight O
jet O
of O
misty O
spray O
, O
and O
these O
words O
underneath O
-- O
`` O
The O
Spouter O
Inn O
: O
-- O
Peter I-PERSON

. O
'' O
Coffin I-PERSON
? O
-- O
Spouter O
? O
-- O
Rather O
ominous O
in O
that O
particular O
connexion O
, O
thought O
I O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
common O
name O
in O
Nantucket O
, O
they O
say O
, O
and O
I O
suppose O
this O
Peter O
here O
is O
an O
emigrant O
from O
there O
. O
As O
the O
light O
looked O
so O
dim O
, O
and O
the O
place O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
looked O
quiet O
enough O
, O
and O
the O
dilapidated O
little O
wooden O
house O
itself O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
might O
have O
been O
carted O
here O
from O
the O
ruins O
of O
some O
burnt O
district O
, O
and O
as O
the O
swinging O
sign O
had O
a O
poverty-stricken O
sort O
of O
creak O
to O
it O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
here O
was O
the O
very O
spot O
for O
cheap O
lodgings O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
pea O
coffee O
. O
It O
was O
a O
queer O
sort O
of O
place O
-- O
a O
gable-ended O
old O
house O
, O
one O
side O
palsied O
as O
it O
were O
, O
and O
leaning O
over O
sadly O
. O
It O
stood O
on O
a O
sharp O
bleak O
corner O
, O
where O
that O
tempestuous O
wind O
Euroclydon O
kept O
up O
a O
worse O
howling O
than O
ever O
it O
did O
about O

any O

his O
feet O
on O

What O
a O
fine O
frosty O
night O
; O
how O
Orion O
glitters O
; O
what O
northern O
lights O
! O
Let O
them O
talk O
of O
their O
oriental O
summer O
climes O
of O
everlasting O
conservatories O
; O
give O
me O
the O
privilege O
of O
making O
my O

But O
what O
thinks O
Lazarus I-PERSON
? O
Can O
he O
warm O
his O
blue O
hands O
by O
holding O
them O
up O
to O
the O
grand O
northern O
lights O
? O
Would O
not O
Lazarus I-PERSON
rather O
be O
in O
Sumatra O
than O
here O
? O
Would O
he O
not O
far O
rather O
lay O
him O
down O
lengthwise O
along O
the O
line O
of O
the O
equator O
; O
yea O
, O
ye O
gods O
! O
go O
down O
to O
the O
fiery O
pit O
itself O
, O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
out O
this O
frost O
? O
Now O
, O
that O
Lazarus I-PERSON
should O
lie O
stranded O
there O
on O
the O
curbstone O
before O
the O
door O
of O
Dives I-PERSON
, O
this O
is O
more O
wonderful O
than O
that O
an O
iceberg O
should O
be O
moored O
to O
one O
of O
the O
Moluccas O
. O
Yet O
Dives I-PERSON
himself O
, O
he O
too O
lives O
like O
a O
Czar O
in O
an O
ice O
palace O
made O
of O
frozen O
sighs O
, O
and O
being O
a O
president O
of O
a O
temperance O
society O
, O
he O
only O
drinks O
the O
tepid O
tears O
of O
orphans O
. O
But O
no O
more O
of O
this O
blubbering O
now O
, O
we O
are O
going O
a-whaling O
, O
and O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
that O
yet O
to O
come O
. O
Let O
us O
scrape O
the O
ice O
from O
our O
frosted O
feet O
, O
and O
see O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
place O
this O

CHAPTER O
3 O
. O
The O
Spouter-Inn O
. O
Entering O
that O
gable-ended O
Spouter-Inn O
, O
you O
found O
yourself O
in O
a O
wide O
, O
low O
, O
straggling O
entry O
with O
old-fashioned O
wainscots O
, O
reminding O
one O
of O
the O
bulwarks O
of O
some O
condemned O
old O
craft O
. O
On O
one O
side O
hung O
a O
very O
large O
oilpainting O
so O
thoroughly O
besmoked O
, O
and O
every O
way O
defaced O
, O
that O
in O
the O
unequal O
crosslights O
by O
which O
you O
viewed O
it O
, O
it O
was O
only O
by O
diligent O
study O
and O
a O
series O
of O
systematic O
visits O
to O
it O
, O
and O
careful O
inquiry O
of O
the O
neighbors O
, O
that O
you O
could O
any O
way O
arrive O
at O
an O
understanding O
of O
its O
purpose O
. O
Such O
unaccountable O
masses O
of O
shades O
and O
shadows O
, O
that O
at O
first O
you O
almost O
thought O
some O
ambitious O
young O
artist O
, O
in O
the O
time O
of O
the O
New O
England O
hags O
, O
had O
endeavored O
to O
delineate O
chaos O
bewitched O
. O
But O
by O
dint O
of O
much O
and O
earnest O
contemplation O
, O
and O
oft O
repeated O
ponderings O
, O
and O
especially O
by O
throwing O
open O
the O
little O
window O
towards O
the O
back O
of O
the O
entry O
, O
you O
at O
last O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
such O
an O
idea O
, O
however O
wild O
, O
might O
not O
be O
altogether O
unwarranted O
. O
But O
what O
most O
puzzled O
and O
confounded O
you O
was O
a O
long O
, O
limber O
, O
portentous O
, O
black O
mass O
of O
something O
hovering O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
picture O
over O
three O
blue O
, O
dim O
, O
perpendicular O
lines O
floating O
in O
a O
nameless O
yeast O
. O
A O
boggy O
, O
soggy O
, O
squitchy O
picture O
truly O
, O
enough O
to O
drive O
a O
nervous O
man O
distracted O
. O
Yet O
was O
there O
a O
sort O
of O
indefinite O
, O
half-attained O
, O
unimaginable O
sublimity O
about O
it O
that O
fairly O
froze O
you O
to O
it O
, O
till O
you O
involuntarily O
took O
an O
oath O
with O
yourself O
to O
find O
out O
what O
that O
marvellous O
painting O
meant O
. O
Ever O
and O
anon O
a O
bright O
, O
but O
, O
alas O
, O
deceptive O
idea O
would O
dart O
you O
through O
. O
-- O
It O
's O
the O
Black O
Sea O
in O
a O
midnight O
gale O
. O
-- O
It O
's O
the O
unnatural O
combat O
of O
the O
four O
primal O
elements O
. O
-- O
It O
's O
a O
blasted O
heath O
. O
-- O
It O
's O
a O
Hyperborean O
winter O
scene O
. O
-- O
It O
's O
the O
breaking-up O
of O
the O
icebound O
stream O
of O
Time O
. O
But O
at O
last O
all O
these O
fancies O
yielded O
to O
that O
one O
portentous O
something O
in O
the O
picture O
's O
midst O
. O
That O
once O
found O
out O
, O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
were O
plain O
. O
But O
stop O
; O
does O
it O
not O
bear O
a O
faint O
resemblance O
to O
a O
gigantic O
fish O
? O
even O
the O
great O
leviathan O
himself O
? O
In O
fact O
, O
the O
artist O
's O
design O
seemed O
this O
: O
a O
final O
theory O
of O
my O
own O
, O
partly O
based O
upon O
the O
aggregated O
opinions O
of O
many O
aged O
persons O
with O
whom O
I O
conversed O
upon O
the O
subject O
. O
The O
picture O
represents O
a O
Cape-Horner O
in O
a O
great O
hurricane O
; O
the O
half-foundered O
ship O
weltering O
there O
with O
its O
three O
dismantled O
masts O
alone O
visible O
; O
and O
an O
exasperated O
whale O
, O
purposing O
to O
spring O
clean O
over O
the O
craft O
, O
is O
in O
the O
enormous O
act O
of O
impaling O
himself O
upon O
the O
three O
mast-heads O
. O
The O
opposite O
wall O
of O
this O
entry O
was O
hung O
all O
over O
with O
a O
heathenish O
array O
of O
monstrous O
clubs O
and O
spears O
. O
Some O
were O
thickly O
set O
with O
glittering O
teeth O
resembling O
ivory O
saws O
; O
others O
were O
tufted O
with O
knots O
of O
human O
hair O
; O
and O
one O
was O
sickle-shaped O
, O
with O
a O
vast O
handle O
sweeping O
round O
like O
the O
segment O
made O
in O
the O
new-mown O
grass O
by O
a O
long-armed O
mower O
. O
You O
shuddered O
as O
you O
gazed O
, O
and O
wondered O
what O
monstrous O
cannibal O
and O
savage O
could O
ever O
have O
gone O
a O
death-harvesting O
with O
such O
a O
hacking O
, O
horrifying O
implement O
. O
Mixed O
with O
these O
were O
rusty O
old O
whaling O
lances O
and O
harpoons O
all O
broken O
and O
deformed O
. O
Some O
were O
storied O
weapons O
. O
With O
this O
once O
long O
lance O
, O
now O
wildly O
elbowed O
, O
fifty O
years O
ago O
did O
Nathan I-PERSON
Swain I-PERSON
kill O
fifteen O
whales O
between O
a O
sunrise O
and O
a O
sunset O
. O
And O
that O
harpoon O
-- O
so O
like O
a O
corkscrew O
now O
-- O
was O
flung O
in O
Javan O
seas O
, O
and O
run O
away O
with O
by O
a O
whale O
, O
years O
afterwards O
slain O
off O
the O
Cape O
of O
Blanco O
. O
The O
original O
iron O
entered O
nigh O
the O
tail O
, O
and O
, O
like O
a O
restless O
needle O
sojourning O
in O
the O
body O
of O
a O
man O
, O
travelled O
full O
forty O
feet O
, O
and O
at O
last O
was O
found O
imbedded O
in O
the O
hump O
. O
Crossing O
this O
dusky O
entry O
, O
and O
on O
through O
yon O
low-arched O
way O
-- O
cut O
through O
what O
in O
old O
times O
must O
have O
been O
a O
great O
central O
chimney O
with O
fireplaces O
all O
round O
-- O
you O
enter O
the O
public O
room O
. O
A O
still O
duskier O
place O
is O
this O
, O
with O
such O
low O
ponderous O
beams O
above O
, O
and O
such O
old O
wrinkled O
planks O
beneath O
, O
that O
you O
would O
almost O
fancy O
you O
trod O
some O
old O
craft O
's O
cockpits O
, O
especially O
of O
such O
a O
howling O
night O
, O
when O
this O
corner-anchored O
old O
ark O
rocked O
so O
furiously O
. O
On O
one O
side O
stood O
a O
long O
, O
low O
, O
shelf-like O
table O
covered O
with O
cracked O
glass O
cases O
, O
filled O
with O
dusty O
rarities O
gathered O
from O
this O
wide O
world O
's O
remotest O
nooks O
. O
Projecting O
from O
the O
further O
angle O
of O
the O
room O
stands O
a O
dark-looking O
den O
-- O
the O
bar O
-- O
a O
rude O
attempt O
at O
a O
right O
whale O
's O
head O
. O
Be O
that O
how O
it O
may O
, O
there O
stands O
the O
vast O
arched O
bone O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
jaw O
, O
so O
wide O
, O
a O
coach O
might O
almost O
drive O
beneath O
it O
. O
Within O
are O
shabby O
shelves O
, O
ranged O
round O
with O
old O
decanters O
, O
bottles O
, O
flasks O
; O
and O
in O
those O
jaws O
of O
swift O
destruction O
, O
like O
another O
cursed O
Jonah I-PERSON
-LRB- O
by O
which O
name O
indeed O
they O
called O
him O
-RRB- O
, O
bustles O
a O
little O
withered O
old O
man O
, O
who O
, O
for O
their O
money O
, O
dearly O
sells O
the O
sailors O
deliriums O
and O
death O
. O
Abominable O
are O
the O
tumblers O
into O
which O
he O
pours O
his O
poison O
. O
Though O
true O
cylinders O
without O
-- O
within O
, O
the O
villanous O
green O
goggling O
glasses O
deceitfully O
tapered O
downwards O
to O
a O
cheating O
bottom O
. O
Parallel O
meridians O
rudely O
pecked O
into O
the O
glass O
, O
surround O
these O
footpads O
' O
goblets O
. O
Fill O
to O
this O
mark O
, O
and O
your O
charge O
is O
but O
a O
penny O
; O
to O
this O
a O
penny O
more O
; O
and O
so O
on O
to O
the O
full O
glass O
-- O
the O
Cape O
Horn O
measure O
, O
which O
you O
may O
gulp O
down O
for O
a O
shilling O
. O
Upon O
entering O
the O
place O
I O
found O
a O
number O
of O
young O
seamen O
gathered O
about O
a O
table O
, O
examining O
by O
a O
dim O
light O
divers O
specimens O
of O
skrimshander O
. O
I O
sought O
the O
landlord O
, O
and O
telling O
him O
I O
desired O
to O
be O
accommodated O
with O
a O
room O
, O
received O
for O
answer O
that O
his O
house O
was O
full O
-- O
not O
a O
bed O
unoccupied O
. O
`` O
But O
avast O
, O
'' O
he O
added O
, O
tapping O
his O
forehead O
, O
`` O
you O
haint O
no O
objections O
to O
sharing O
a O
harpooneer O

blanket O
, O
have O
ye O
? O
I O

' O
pose O
you O
are O
goin O

a-whalin O

, O
so O
you O
'd O
better O
get O
used O
to O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O
'' O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
never O
liked O
to O
sleep O
two O
in O
a O
bed O
; O
that O
if O
I O
should O
ever O
do O
so O
, O
it O
would O
depend O
upon O
who O
the O
harpooneer O
might O
be O
, O
and O
that O
if O
he O
-LRB- O
the O
landlord O
-RRB- O
really O
had O
no O
other O
place O
for O
me O
, O
and O
the O
harpooneer O
was O
not O
decidedly O
objectionable O
, O
why O
rather O
than O
wander O
further O
about O
a O
strange O
town O
on O
so O
bitter O
a O
night O
, O
I O
would O
put O
up O
with O
the O
half O
of O
any O
decent O
man O
's O
blanket O
. O
`` O
I O
thought O
so O

All O
right O

a O
seat O

Supper O
? O
-- O
you O
want O
supper O
? O
Supper O
'll O
be O
ready O
directly O
. O
'' O
I O
sat O
down O
on O
an O
old O
wooden O
settle O
, O
carved O
all O
over O
like O
a O
bench O
on O
the O
Battery O
. O
At O
one O
end O
a O
ruminating O
tar O
was O
still O
further O
adorning O
it O
with O
his O
jack-knife O
, O
stooping O
over O
and O
diligently O
working O
away O
at O
the O
space O
between O
his O
legs O
. O
He O
was O
trying O
his O
hand O
at O
a O
ship O
under O
full O
sail O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
make O
much O
headway O
, O
I O
thought O
. O
At O
last O
some O
four O
or O
five O
of O
us O
were O
summoned O
to O
our O
meal O
in O
an O
adjoining O
room O
. O
It O
was O
cold O
as O
Iceland O
-- O
no O
fire O
at O
all O
-- O
the O
landlord O
said O
he O
could O
n't O
afford O
it O
. O
Nothing O
but O
two O
dismal O
tallow O
candles O
, O
each O
in O
a O
winding O
sheet O
. O
We O
were O
fain O
to O
button O
up O
our O
monkey O
jackets O
, O
and O
hold O
to O
our O
lips O
cups O
of O
scalding O
tea O
with O
our O
half O
frozen O
fingers O
. O
But O
the O
fare O
was O
of O
the O
most O
substantial O
kind O
-- O
not O
only O
meat O
and O
potatoes O
, O
but O
dumplings O
; O
good O
heavens O
! O
dumplings O
for O
supper O
! O
One O
young O
fellow O
in O
a O
green O
box O
coat O
, O
addressed O
himself O
to O
these O
dumplings O
in O
a O
most O
direful O
manner O
. O
`` O
My O
boy O
, O
'' O
said O
the O
landlord O
, O
`` O
you O

'' O
`` O
Oh O

no O

said O
he O

looking O
a O
sort O
of O
diabolically O
funny O

`` O

`` O

he O
here O

'' O
`` O
He O
'll O

here O
afore O
long O

'' O
was O
the O
answer O
. O
I O
could O
not O
help O
it O
, O
but O
I O
began O
to O
feel O
suspicious O
of O
this O
`` O
dark O
complexioned O
'' O
harpooneer O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
that O
if O
it O
so O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
should O
sleep O
together O
, O
he O
must O
undress O

get O
into O
bed O
before O
I O
did O

Supper O
over O
, O
the O
company O
went O
back O
to O
the O
bar-room O
, O
when O
, O
knowing O
not O
what O
else O
to O
do O
with O
myself O
, O
I O
resolved O
to O
spend O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
as O
a O
looker O
on O
. O
Presently O
a O
rioting O
noise O
was O
heard O
without O
. O
Starting O
up O
, O
the O
landlord O
cried O
, O
`` O
That O

A O
tramping O

in O
the O
entry O

the O
door O

rolled O

. O
They O
had O
just O
landed O
from O
their O
boat O
, O
and O
this O
was O
the O
first O
house O
they O
entered O
. O
No O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
that O
they O
made O
a O
straight O
wake O
for O
the O
whale O
's O
mouth O
-- O
the O
bar O
-- O
when O
the O
wrinkled O
little O
old O
Jonah I-PERSON
, O
there O
officiating O
, O
soon O
poured O
them O
out O
brimmers O
all O
round O
. O
One O
complained O
of O
a O
bad O
cold O
in O
his O
head O
, O
upon O
which O
Jonah I-PERSON
mixed O
him O
a O
pitch-like O
potion O
of O
gin O
and O
molasses O
, O
which O
he O
swore O
was O
a O
sovereign O
cure O
for O
all O
colds O
and O
catarrhs O
whatsoever O
, O
never O
mind O
of O
how O
long O
standing O
, O
or O
whether O
caught O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
Labrador O
, O
or O
on O
the O
weather O
side O
of O
an O
ice-island O
. O
The O
liquor O
soon O
mounted O
into O
their O
heads O
, O
as O
it O
generally O
does O
even O
with O
the O
arrantest O
topers O
newly O
landed O
from O
sea O
, O
and O
they O
began O
capering O
about O
most O
obstreperously O
. O
I O
observed O
, O
however O
, O
that O
one O
of O
them O
held O
somewhat O
aloof O
, O
and O
though O
he O
seemed O
desirous O
not O
to O
spoil O
the O
hilarity O
of O
his O
shipmates O
by O
his O
own O
sober O
face O
, O
yet O
upon O
the O
whole O
he O
refrained O
from O
making O
as O
much O
noise O
as O
the O
rest O
. O
This O
man O
interested O
me O
at O
once O
; O
and O
since O
the O
sea-gods O
had O
ordained O
that O
he O
should O
soon O
become O
my O
shipmate O
-LRB- O
though O
but O
a O
sleeping-partner O
one O
, O
so O
far O
as O
this O
narrative O
is O
concerned O
-RRB- O
, O
I O
will O
here O
venture O
upon O
a O
little O
description O
of O
him O
. O
He O
stood O
full O
six O
feet O
in O
height O
, O
with O
noble O
shoulders O
, O
and O
a O
chest O
like O
a O
coffer-dam O
. O
I O
have O
seldom O
seen O
such O
brawn O
in O
a O
man O
. O
His O
face O
was O
deeply O
brown O
and O
burnt O
, O
making O
his O
white O
teeth O
dazzling O
by O
the O
contrast O
; O
while O
in O
the O
deep O
shadows O
of O
his O
eyes O
floated O
some O
reminiscences O
that O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
give O
him O
much O
joy O
. O
His O
voice O
at O
once O
announced O
that O
he O
was O
a O
Southerner O
, O
and O
from O
his O
fine O
stature O
, O
I O
thought O
he O
must O
be O
one O
of O
those O
tall O
mountaineers O
from O
the O
Alleghanian O
Ridge O
in O
Virginia O
. O
When O
the O
revelry O
of O
his O
companions O
had O
mounted O
to O
its O
height O
, O
this O
man O
slipped O
away O
unobserved O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
no O
more O
of O
him O
till O
he O
became O
my O
comrade O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
however O
, O
he O
was O
missed O
by O
his O
shipmates O
, O
and O
being O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
for O
some O
reason O
a O
huge O
favourite O
with O
them O
, O
they O
raised O
a O
cry O
of O
`` O
Bulkington O
! O
Bulkington O
! O
where O
's O
Bulkington O
? O
'' O
and O
darted O
out O
of O
the O
house O
in O
pursuit O
of O
him O
. O
It O
was O
now O
about O
nine O
oâ€™clock O
, O
and O
the O
room O
seeming O
almost O
supernaturally O
quiet O
after O
these O
orgies O
, O
I O
began O
to O
congratulate O
myself O
upon O
a O
little O
plan O
that O
had O
occurred O
to O
me O
just O
previous O
to O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
seamen O
. O
No O
man O
prefers O
to O
sleep O
two O
in O
a O
bed O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
you O
would O
a O
good O
deal O
rather O
not O
sleep O
with O
your O
own O
brother O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
is O
, O
but O
people O
like O
to O
be O
private O
when O
they O
are O
sleeping O
. O
And O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
sleeping O
with O
an O
unknown O
stranger O
, O
in O
a O
strange O
inn O
, O
in O
a O
strange O
town O
, O
and O
that O
stranger O
a O
harpooneer O
, O
then O
your O
objections O
indefinitely O
multiply O
. O
Nor O
was O
there O
any O
earthly O
reason O
why O
I O
as O
a O
sailor O
should O
sleep O
two O
in O
a O
bed O
, O
more O
than O
anybody O
else O
; O
for O
sailors O
no O
more O
sleep O
two O
in O
a O
bed O
at O
sea O
, O
than O
bachelor O
Kings O
do O
ashore O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
they O
all O
sleep O
together O
in O
one O
apartment O
, O
but O
you O
have O
your O
own O
hammock O
, O
and O
cover O
yourself O
with O
your O
own O
blanket O
, O
and O
sleep O
in O
your O
own O
skin O
. O
The O
more O
I O
pondered O
over O
this O
harpooneer O
, O
the O
more O
I O
abominated O
the O
thought O
of O
sleeping O
with O
him O
. O
It O
was O
fair O
to O
presume O
that O
being O
a O
harpooneer O
, O
his O
linen O
or O
woollen O
, O
as O
the O
case O
might O
be O
, O
would O
not O
be O
of O
the O
tidiest O
, O
certainly O
none O
of O
the O
finest O
. O
I O
began O
to O
twitch O
all O
over O
. O
Besides O
, O
it O
was O
getting O
late O
, O
and O
my O
decent O
harpooneer O
ought O
to O
be O
home O
and O
going O
bedwards O
. O
Suppose O
now O
, O
he O
should O
tumble O
in O
upon O
me O
at O
midnight O
-- O
how O
could O
I O
tell O
from O
what O
vile O
hole O
he O
had O
been O
coming O
? O
`` O
Landlord O
! O
I O
've O
changed O
my O
mind O
about O
that O
harpooneer O
. O
-- O
I O
sha O
n't O
sleep O
with O
him O
. O
I O
'll O
try O
the O
bench O
here O
. O
'' O
`` O
Just O
as O
you O
please O
; O
I O
'm O
sorry O
I O
ca O
n't O
spare O
ye O
a O
tablecloth O
for O
a O
mattress O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
plaguy O
rough O
board O
here O
'' O
-- O
feeling O
of O
the O
knots O
and O
notches O
. O
`` O
But O
wait O
a O
bit O
, O
Skrimshander O
; O
I O
've O
got O
a O
carpenter O
's O
plane O
there O
in O
the O
bar O
-- O
wait O
, O
I O
say O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
make O
ye O
snug O
enough O
. O
'' O
So O
saying O
he O
procured O
the O
plane O
; O
and O
with O
his O
old O
silk O
handkerchief O
first O
dusting O
the O
bench O
, O
vigorously O
set O
to O
planing O
away O
at O
my O
bed O
, O
the O
while O
grinning O
like O
an O
ape O
. O
The O
shavings O
flew O
right O
and O
left O
; O
till O
at O
last O
the O
plane-iron O
came O
bump O
against O
an O
indestructible O
knot O
. O
The O
landlord O
was O
near O
spraining O
his O
wrist O
, O
and O
I O
told O
him O
for O
heaven O
's O
sake O
to O
quit O
-- O
the O
bed O
was O
soft O
enough O
to O
suit O
me O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
know O
how O
all O
the O
planing O
in O
the O
world O
could O
make O
eider O
down O
of O
a O
pine O
plank O
. O
So O
gathering O
up O
the O
shavings O
with O
another O
grin O
, O
and O
throwing O
them O
into O
the O
great O
stove O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
, O
he O
went O
about O
his O
business O
, O
and O
left O
me O
in O
a O
brown O
study O
. O
I O
now O
took O
the O
measure O
of O
the O
bench O
, O
and O
found O
that O
it O
was O
a O
foot O
too O
short O
; O
but O
that O
could O
be O
mended O
with O
a O
chair O
. O
But O
it O
was O
a O
foot O
too O
narrow O
, O
and O
the O
other O
bench O
in O
the O
room O
was O
about O
four O
inches O
higher O
than O
the O
planed O
one O
-- O
so O
there O
was O
no O
yoking O
them O
. O
I O
then O
placed O
the O
first O
bench O
lengthwise O
along O
the O
only O
clear O
space O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
leaving O
a O
little O
interval O
between O
, O
for O
my O
back O
to O
settle O
down O
in O
. O
But O
I O
soon O
found O
that O
there O
came O
such O
a O
draught O
of O
cold O
air O
over O
me O
from O
under O
the O
sill O
of O
the O
window O
, O
that O
this O
plan O
would O
never O
do O
at O
all O
, O
especially O
as O
another O
current O
from O
the O
rickety O
door O
met O
the O
one O
from O
the O
window O
, O
and O
both O
together O
formed O
a O
series O
of O
small O
whirlwinds O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity O
of O
the O
spot O
where O
I O
had O
thought O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
. O
The O
devil O
fetch O
that O
harpooneer O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
but O
stop O
, O
could O
n't O
I O
steal O
a O
march O
on O
him O
-- O
bolt O
his O
door O
inside O
, O
and O
jump O
into O
his O
bed O
, O
not O
to O
be O
wakened O
by O
the O
most O
violent O
knockings O
? O
It O
seemed O
no O
bad O
idea O
; O
but O
upon O
second O
thoughts O
I O
dismissed O
it O
. O
For O
who O
could O
tell O
but O
what O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
I O
popped O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
the O
harpooneer O
might O
be O
standing O
in O
the O
entry O
, O
all O
ready O
to O
knock O
me O
down O
! O
Still O
, O
looking O
round O
me O
again O
, O
and O
seeing O
no O
possible O
chance O
of O
spending O
a O
sufferable O
night O
unless O
in O
some O
other O
person O
's O
bed O
, O
I O
began O
to O
think O
that O
after O
all O
I O
might O
be O
cherishing O
unwarrantable O
prejudices O
against O
this O
unknown O
harpooneer O
. O
Thinks O
I O
, O
I O
'll O
wait O
awhile O
; O
he O
must O
be O
dropping O
in O
before O
long O
. O
I O
'll O
have O
a O
good O
look O
at O
him O
then O
, O
and O
perhaps O
we O
may O
become O
jolly O
good O
bedfellows O
after O
all O
-- O
there O
's O
no O
telling O
. O
But O
though O
the O
other O
boarders O
kept O
coming O
in O
by O
ones O
, O
twos O
, O
and O
threes O
, O
and O
going O
to O
bed O
, O
yet O
no O
sign O
of O
my O
harpooneer O
. O
`` O
Landlord O
! O
'' O
said O
I O
, O
`` O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
chap O
is O
he O
-- O
does O
he O
always O
keep O
such O
late O
hours O
? O
'' O
It O
was O
now O
hard O
upon O
twelve O
oâ€™clock O
. O
The O
landlord O
chuckled O
again O
with O
his O
lean O
chuckle O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
mightily O
tickled O
at O
something O
beyond O
my O
comprehension O
. O
`` O
No O
, O
'' O
he O
answered O
, O
`` O
generally O
he O
's O
an O
early O

'' O
This O
account O
cleared O
up O
the O
otherwise O
unaccountable O
mystery O
, O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
landlord O
, O
after O
all O
, O
had O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
fooling O
me O
-- O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
what O
could O
I O
think O
of O
a O
harpooneer O
who O
stayed O
out O
of O
a O
Saturday O
night O
clean O
into O
the O
holy O
Sabbath O
, O
engaged O
in O
such O
a O
cannibal O
business O
as O
selling O
the O
heads O
of O
dead O
idolators O
? O
`` O
Depend O
upon O
it O
, O
landlord O
, O
that O
harpooneer O
is O
a O
dangerous O
man O
. O
'' O
`` O
He O
pays O
reg O
' O
lar O
, O
'' O
was O
the O
rejoinder O
. O
`` O
But O
come O
, O
it O
's O
getting O
dreadful O
late O
, O
you O
had O
better O
be O
turning O
flukes O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
bed O
; O
Sal I-PERSON
and O
me O
slept O
in O
that O
ere O
bed O
the O
night O
we O
were O
spliced O
. O
There O
's O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
two O
to O
kick O
about O
in O
that O
bed O
; O
it O
's O
an O
almighty O
big O
bed O
that O
. O
Why O
, O
afore O
we O
give O
it O
up O
, O
Sal I-PERSON
used O
to O
put O
our O
Sam I-PERSON
and O
little O
Johnny I-PERSON
in O
the O
foot O
of O
it O
. O
But O
I O
got O
a O
dreaming O
and O
sprawling O
about O
one O
night O
, O
and O
somehow O
, O
Sam O
got O
pitched O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
came O
near O
breaking O
his O
arm O
. O
Arter O
that O
, O
Sal I-PERSON
said O
it O
would O
n't O
do O
. O
Come O
along O
here O
, O
I O
'll O
give O
ye O
a O
glim O
in O
a O
jiffy O
; O
'' O
and O
so O
saying O
he O
lighted O
a O
candle O
and O
held O
it O
towards O
me O
, O
offering O
to O
lead O
the O
way O
. O
But O
I O
stood O
irresolute O
; O
when O
looking O
at O
a O
clock O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
he O
exclaimed O
`` O
I O
vum O
it O
's O
Sunday O
-- O
you O
wo O
n't O
see O
that O
harpooneer O
to-night O
; O
he O
's O
come O
to O
anchor O
somewhere O
-- O
come O
along O
then O
; O
do O
come O
; O
wo O
n't O
ye O
come O
? O
'' O
I O
considered O
the O
matter O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
up O
stairs O
we O
went O
, O
and O
I O
was O
ushered O
into O
a O
small O
room O
, O
cold O
as O
a O
clam O
, O
and O
furnished O
, O
sure O
enough O
, O
with O
a O
prodigious O
bed O
, O
almost O
big O
enough O
indeed O
for O
any O
four O
harpooneers O
to O
sleep O
abreast O
. O
`` O
There O
, O
'' O
said O
the O
landlord O
, O
placing O
the O
candle O
on O
a O
crazy O
old O
sea O
chest O
that O
did O
double O
duty O
as O
a O
wash-stand O
and O
centre O
table O
; O
`` O
there O
, O
make O
yourself O
comfortable O
now O
, O
and O
good O
night O
to O
ye O
. O
'' O
I O
turned O
round O
from O
eyeing O
the O
bed O
, O
but O
he O
had O
disappeared O
. O
Folding O
back O
the O
counterpane O
, O
I O
stooped O
over O
the O
bed O
. O
Though O
none O
of O
the O
most O
elegant O
, O
it O
yet O
stood O
the O
scrutiny O
tolerably O
well O
. O
I O
then O
glanced O
round O
the O
room O
; O
and O
besides O
the O
bedstead O
and O
centre O
table O
, O
could O
see O
no O
other O
furniture O
belonging O
to O
the O
place O
, O
but O
a O
rude O
shelf O
, O
the O
four O
walls O
, O
and O
a O
papered O
fireboard O
representing O
a O
man O
striking O
a O
whale O
. O
Of O
things O
not O
properly O
belonging O
to O
the O
room O
, O
there O
was O
a O
hammock O
lashed O
up O
, O
and O
thrown O
upon O
the O
floor O
in O
one O
corner O
; O
also O
a O
large O
seaman O
's O
bag O
, O
containing O
the O
harpooneer O
's O
wardrobe O
, O
no O
doubt O
in O
lieu O
of O
a O
land O
trunk O
. O
Likewise O
, O
there O
was O
a O
parcel O
of O
outlandish O
bone O
fish O
hooks O
on O
the O
shelf O
over O
the O
fire-place O
, O
and O
a O
tall O
harpoon O
standing O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
bed O
. O
But O
what O
is O
this O
on O
the O
chest O
? O
I O
took O
it O
up O
, O
and O
held O
it O
close O
to O
the O
light O
, O
and O
felt O
it O
, O
and O
smelt O
it O
, O
and O
tried O
every O
way O
possible O
to O
arrive O
at O
some O
satisfactory O
conclusion O
concerning O
it O
. O
I O
can O
compare O
it O
to O
nothing O
but O
a O
large O
door O
mat O
, O
ornamented O
at O
the O
edges O
with O
little O
tinkling O
tags O
something O
like O
the O
stained O
porcupine O
quills O
round O
an O
Indian O
moccasin O
. O
There O
was O
a O
hole O
or O
slit O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
mat O
, O
as O
you O
see O
the O
same O
in O
South O
American O
ponchos O
. O
But O
could O
it O
be O
possible O
that O
any O
sober O
harpooneer O
would O
get O
into O
a O
door O
mat O
, O
and O
parade O
the O
streets O
of O
any O
Christian O
town O
in O
that O
sort O
of O
guise O
? O
I O
put O
it O
on O
, O
to O
try O
it O
, O
and O
it O
weighed O
me O
down O
like O
a O
hamper O
, O
being O
uncommonly O
shaggy O
and O
thick O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
a O
little O
damp O
, O
as O
though O
this O
mysterious O
harpooneer O
had O
been O
wearing O
it O
of O
a O
rainy O
day O
. O
I O
went O
up O
in O
it O
to O
a O
bit O
of O
glass O
stuck O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
sight O
in O
my O
life O
. O
I O
tore O
myself O
out O
of O
it O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
that O
I O
gave O
myself O
a O
kink O
in O
the O
neck O
. O
I O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
commenced O
thinking O
about O
this O
head-peddling O
harpooneer O
, O
and O
his O
door O
mat O
. O
After O
thinking O
some O
time O
on O
the O
bed-side O
, O
I O
got O
up O
and O
took O
off O
my O
monkey O
jacket O
, O
and O
then O
stood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
thinking O
. O
I O
then O
took O
off O
my O
coat O
, O
and O
thought O
a O
little O
more O
in O
my O
shirt O
sleeves O
. O
But O
beginning O
to O
feel O
very O
cold O
now O
, O
half O
undressed O
as O
I O
was O
, O
and O
remembering O
what O
the O
landlord O
said O
about O
the O
harpooneer O
's O
not O
coming O
home O
at O
all O
that O
night O
, O
it O
being O
so O
very O
late O
, O
I O
made O
no O
more O
ado O
, O
but O
jumped O
out O
of O
my O
pantaloons O
and O
boots O
, O
and O
then O
blowing O
out O
the O
light O
tumbled O
into O
bed O
, O
and O
commended O
myself O
to O
the O
care O
of O
heaven O
. O
Whether O
that O
mattress O
was O
stuffed O
with O
corn-cobs O
or O
broken O
crockery O
, O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
, O
but O
I O
rolled O
about O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
and O
could O
not O
sleep O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
At O
last O
I O
slid O
off O
into O
a O
light O
doze O
, O
and O
had O
pretty O
nearly O
made O
a O
good O
offing O
towards O
the O
land O
of O
Nod O
, O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
heavy O
footfall O
in O
the O
passage O
, O
and O
saw O
a O
glimmer O
of O
light O
come O
into O
the O
room O
from O
under O
the O
door O
. O
Lord O
save O
me O
, O
thinks O
I O
, O
that O
must O
be O
the O
harpooneer O
, O
the O
infernal O
head-peddler O
. O
But O
I O
lay O
perfectly O
still O
, O
and O
resolved O
not O
to O
say O
a O
word O
till O
spoken O
to O
. O
Holding O
a O
light O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
that O
identical O
New O
Zealand O
head O
in O
the O
other O
, O
the O
stranger O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
and O
without O
looking O
towards O
the O
bed O
, O
placed O
his O
candle O
a O
good O
way O
off O
from O
me O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
one O
corner O
, O
and O
then O
began O
working O
away O
at O
the O
knotted O
cords O
of O
the O
large O
bag O
I O
before O
spoke O
of O
as O
being O
in O
the O
room O
. O
I O
was O
all O
eagerness O
to O
see O
his O
face O
, O
but O
he O
kept O
it O
averted O
for O
some O
time O
while O
employed O
in O
unlacing O
the O
bag O
's O
mouth O
. O
This O
accomplished O
, O
however O
, O
he O
turned O
round O
-- O
when O
, O
good O
heavens O
! O
what O
a O
sight O
! O
Such O
a O
face O
! O
It O
was O
of O
a O
dark O
, O
purplish O
, O
yellow O
colour O
, O
here O
and O
there O
stuck O
over O
with O
large O
blackish O
looking O
squares O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
's O
just O
as O
I O
thought O
, O
he O
's O
a O
terrible O
bedfellow O
; O
he O
's O
been O
in O
a O
fight O
, O
got O
dreadfully O
cut O
, O
and O
here O
he O
is O
, O
just O
from O
the O
surgeon O
. O
But O
at O
that O
moment O
he O
chanced O
to O
turn O
his O
face O
so O
towards O
the O
light O
, O
that O
I O
plainly O
saw O
they O
could O
not O
be O
sticking-plasters O
at O
all O
, O
those O
black O
squares O
on O
his O
cheeks O
. O
They O
were O
stains O
of O
some O
sort O
or O
other O
. O
At O
first O
I O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
make O
of O
this O
; O
but O
soon O
an O
inkling O
of O
the O
truth O
occurred O
to O
me O
. O
I O
remembered O
a O
story O
of O
a O
white O
man O
-- O
a O
whaleman O
too O
-- O
who O
, O
falling O
among O
the O
cannibals O
, O
had O
been O
tattooed O
by O
them O
. O
I O
concluded O
that O
this O
harpooneer O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
his O
distant O
voyages O
, O
must O
have O
met O
with O
a O
similar O
adventure O
. O
And O
what O
is O
it O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
after O
all O
! O
It O
's O
only O
his O
outside O
; O
a O
man O
can O
be O
honest O
in O
any O
sort O
of O
skin O
. O
But O
then O
, O
what O
to O
make O
of O
his O
unearthly O
complexion O
, O
that O
part O
of O
it O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
lying O
round O
about O
, O
and O
completely O
independent O
of O
the O
squares O
of O
tattooing O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
might O
be O
nothing O
but O
a O
good O
coat O
of O
tropical O
tanning O
; O
but O
I O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
hot O
sun O
's O
tanning O
a O
white O
man O
into O
a O
purplish O
yellow O
one O
. O
However O
, O
I O
had O
never O
been O
in O
the O
South O
Seas O
; O
and O
perhaps O
the O
sun O
there O
produced O
these O
extraordinary O
effects O
upon O
the O
skin O
. O
Now O
, O
while O
all O
these O
ideas O
were O
passing O
through O
me O
like O
lightning O
, O
this O
harpooneer O
never O
noticed O
me O
at O
all O
. O
But O
, O
after O
some O
difficulty O
having O
opened O
his O
bag O
, O
he O
commenced O
fumbling O
in O
it O
, O
and O
presently O
pulled O
out O
a O
sort O
of O
tomahawk O
, O
and O
a O
seal-skin O
wallet O
with O
the O
hair O
on O
. O
Placing O
these O
on O
the O
old O
chest O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
, O
he O
then O
took O
the O
New O
Zealand O
head O
-- O
a O
ghastly O
thing O
enough O
-- O
and O
crammed O
it O
down O
into O
the O
bag O
. O
He O
now O
took O
off O
his O
hat O
-- O
a O
new O
beaver O
hat O
-- O
when O
I O
came O
nigh O
singing O
out O
with O
fresh O
surprise O
. O
There O
was O
no O
hair O
on O
his O
head O
-- O
none O
to O
speak O
of O
at O
least O
-- O
nothing O
but O
a O
small O
scalp-knot O
twisted O
up O
on O
his O
forehead O
. O
His O
bald O
purplish O
head O
now O
looked O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
a O
mildewed O
skull O
. O
Had O
not O
the O
stranger O
stood O
between O
me O
and O
the O
door O
, O
I O
would O
have O
bolted O
out O
of O
it O
quicker O
than O
ever O
I O
bolted O
a O
dinner O
. O
Even O
as O
it O
was O
, O
I O
thought O
something O
of O
slipping O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
second O
floor O
back O
. O
I O
am O
no O
coward O
, O
but O
what O
to O
make O
of O
this O
head-peddling O
purple O
rascal O
altogether O
passed O
my O
comprehension O
. O
Ignorance O
is O
the O
parent O
of O
fear O
, O
and O
being O
completely O
nonplussed O
and O
confounded O
about O
the O
stranger O
, O
I O
confess O
I O
was O
now O
as O
much O
afraid O
of O
him O
as O
if O
it O
was O
the O
devil O
himself O
who O
had O
thus O
broken O
into O
my O
room O
at O
the O
dead O
of O
night O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
so O
afraid O
of O
him O
that O
I O
was O
not O
game O
enough O
just O
then O
to O
address O
him O
, O
and O
demand O
a O
satisfactory O
answer O
concerning O
what O
seemed O
inexplicable O
in O
him O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
he O
continued O
the O
business O
of O
undressing O
, O
and O
at O
last O
showed O
his O
chest O
and O
arms O
. O
As O
I O
live O
, O
these O
covered O
parts O
of O
him O
were O
checkered O
with O
the O
same O
squares O
as O
his O
face O
; O
his O
back O
, O
too O
, O
was O
all O
over O
the O
same O
dark O
squares O
; O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
in O
a O
Thirty O
Years O
' O
War O
, O
and O
just O
escaped O
from O
it O
with O
a O
sticking-plaster O
shirt O
. O
Still O
more O
, O
his O
very O
legs O
were O
marked O
, O
as O
if O
a O
parcel O
of O
dark O
green O
frogs O
were O
running O
up O
the O
trunks O
of O
young O
palms O
. O
It O
was O
now O
quite O
plain O
that O
he O
must O
be O
some O
abominable O
savage O
or O
other O
shipped O
aboard O
of O
a O
whaleman O
in O
the O
South O
Seas O
, O
and O
so O
landed O
in O
this O
Christian O
country O
. O
I O
quaked O
to O
think O
of O
it O
. O
A O
peddler O
of O
heads O
too O
-- O
perhaps O
the O
heads O
of O
his O
own O
brothers O
. O
He O
might O
take O
a O
fancy O
to O
mine O
-- O
heavens O
! O
look O
at O
that O
tomahawk O
! O
But O
there O
was O
no O
time O
for O
shuddering O
, O
for O
now O
the O
savage O
went O
about O
something O
that O
completely O
fascinated O
my O
attention O
, O
and O
convinced O
me O
that O
he O
must O
indeed O
be O
a O
heathen O
. O
Going O
to O
his O
heavy O
grego O
, O
or O
wrapall O
, O
or O
dreadnaught O
, O
which O
he O
had O
previously O
hung O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
he O
fumbled O
in O
the O
pockets O
, O
and O
produced O
at O
length O
a O
curious O
little O
deformed O
image O
with O
a O
hunch O
on O
its O
back O
, O
and O
exactly O
the O
colour O
of O
a O
three O
days O
' O
old O
Congo O
baby O
. O
Remembering O
the O
embalmed O
head O
, O
at O
first O
I O
almost O
thought O
that O
this O
black O
manikin O
was O
a O
real O
baby O
preserved O
in O
some O
similar O
manner O
. O
But O
seeing O
that O
it O
was O
not O
at O
all O
limber O
, O
and O
that O
it O
glistened O
a O
good O
deal O
like O
polished O
ebony O
, O
I O
concluded O
that O
it O
must O
be O
nothing O
but O
a O
wooden O
idol O
, O
which O
indeed O
it O
proved O
to O
be O
. O
For O
now O
the O
savage O
goes O
up O
to O
the O
empty O
fire-place O
, O
and O
removing O
the O
papered O
fire-board O
, O
sets O
up O
this O
little O
hunch-backed O
image O
, O
like O
a O
tenpin O
, O
between O
the O
andirons O
. O
The O
chimney O
jambs O
and O
all O
the O
bricks O
inside O
were O
very O
sooty O
, O
so O
that O
I O
thought O
this O
fire-place O
made O
a O
very O
appropriate O
little O
shrine O
or O
chapel O
for O
his O
Congo O
idol O
. O
I O
now O
screwed O
my O
eyes O
hard O
towards O
the O
half O
hidden O
image O
, O
feeling O
but O
ill O
at O
ease O
meantime O
-- O
to O
see O
what O
was O
next O
to O
follow O
. O
First O
he O
takes O
about O
a O
double O
handful O
of O
shavings O
out O
of O
his O
grego O
pocket O
, O
and O
places O
them O
carefully O
before O
the O
idol O
; O
then O
laying O
a O
bit O
of O
ship O
biscuit O
on O
top O
and O
applying O
the O
flame O
from O
the O
lamp O
, O
he O
kindled O
the O
shavings O
into O
a O
sacrificial O
blaze O
. O
Presently O
, O
after O
many O
hasty O
snatches O
into O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
still O
hastier O
withdrawals O
of O
his O
fingers O
-LRB- O
whereby O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
scorching O
them O
badly O
-RRB- O
, O
he O
at O
last O
succeeded O
in O
drawing O
out O
the O
biscuit O
; O
then O
blowing O
off O
the O
heat O
and O
ashes O
a O
little O
, O
he O
made O
a O
polite O
offer O
of O
it O
to O
the O
little O
negro O
. O
But O
the O
little O
devil O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
fancy O
such O
dry O
sort O
of O
fare O
at O
all O
; O
he O
never O
moved O
his O
lips O
. O
All O
these O
strange O
antics O
were O
accompanied O
by O
still O
stranger O
guttural O
noises O
from O
the O
devotee O
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
be O
praying O
in O
a O
sing-song O
or O
else O
singing O
some O
pagan O
psalmody O
or O
other O
, O
during O
which O
his O
face O
twitched O
about O
in O
the O
most O
unnatural O
manner O
. O
At O
last O
extinguishing O
the O
fire O
, O
he O
took O
the O
idol O
up O
very O
unceremoniously O
, O
and O
bagged O
it O
again O
in O
his O
grego O
pocket O
as O
carelessly O
as O
if O
he O
were O
a O
sportsman O
bagging O
a O
dead O
woodcock O
. O
All O
these O
queer O
proceedings O
increased O
my O
uncomfortableness O
, O
and O
seeing O
him O
now O
exhibiting O
strong O
symptoms O
of O
concluding O
his O
business O
operations O
, O
and O
jumping O
into O
bed O
with O
me O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
high O
time O
, O
now O
or O
never O
, O
before O
the O
light O
was O
put O
out O
, O
to O
break O
the O
spell O
in O
which O
I O
had O
so O
long O
been O
bound O
. O
But O
the O
interval O
I O
spent O
in O
deliberating O
what O
to O
say O
, O
was O
a O
fatal O
one O
. O
Taking O
up O
his O
tomahawk O
from O
the O
table O
, O
he O
examined O
the O
head O
of O
it O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
and O
then O
holding O
it O
to O
the O
light O
, O
with O
his O
mouth O
at O
the O
handle O
, O
he O
puffed O
out O
great O
clouds O
of O
tobacco O
smoke O
. O
The O
next O
moment O
the O
light O
was O
extinguished O
, O
and O
this O
wild O
cannibal O
, O
tomahawk O
between O
his O
teeth O
, O
sprang O
into O
bed O
with O
me O
. O
I O
sang O
out O
, O
I O
could O
not O
help O
it O
now O
; O
and O
giving O
a O
sudden O
grunt O
of O
astonishment O
he O
began O
feeling O
me O
. O
Stammering O
out O
something O
, O
I O
knew O
not O
what O
, O
I O
rolled O
away O
from O
him O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
then O
conjured O
him O
, O
whoever O
or O
whatever O
he O
might O
be O
, O
to O
keep O
quiet O
, O
and O
let O
me O
get O
up O
and O
light O
the O
lamp O
again O
. O
But O
his O
guttural O
responses O
satisfied O
me O
at O
once O
that O
he O
but O
ill O
comprehended O
my O
meaning O
. O
`` O
Who-e O
debel O
you O
? O
'' O
-- O
he O
at O
last O
said O
-- O
`` O
you O
no O
speak-e O
, O
dam-me O
, O
I O
kill-e O
. O
'' O
And O
so O
saying O
the O
lighted O
tomahawk O
began O
flourishing O
about O
me O
in O
the O
dark O
. O
`` O
Landlord O
, O
for O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
Peter I-PERSON
Coffin I-PERSON
! O
'' O
shouted O
I. O
`` O
Landlord O
! O
Watch O
! O
Coffin I-PERSON
! O
Angels O
! O
save O
me O
! O
'' O
`` O
Speak-e O
! O
tell-ee O
me O
who-ee O
be O
, O
or O
dam-me O
, O
I O
kill-e O
! O
'' O
again O
growled O
the O
cannibal O
, O
while O
his O
horrid O
flourishings O
of O
the O
tomahawk O
scattered O
the O
hot O
tobacco O
ashes O
about O
me O
till O
I O
thought O
my O
linen O
would O
get O
on O
fire O
. O
But O
thank O
heaven O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
the O
landlord O
came O
into O
the O
room O
light O
in O
hand O
, O
and O
leaping O
from O
the O
bed O
I O
ran O
up O
to O
him O
. O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
now O
, O
'' O
said O
he O
, O
grinning O
again O
, O
`` O
Queequeg O
here O
would O
n't O
harm O
a O
hair O
of O
your O
head O
. O
'' O
`` O
Stop O
your O
grinning O
, O
'' O
shouted O
I O
, O
`` O
and O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
tell O
me O
that O
that O
infernal O
harpooneer O
was O
a O

'' O
`` O
I O

again O
and O
go O
to O

`` O

-- O
grunted O
Queequeg I-PERSON
, O
puffing O
away O
at O
his O
pipe O
and O
sitting O
up O
in O
bed O
. O
`` O
You O
gettee O
in O
, O
'' O
he O
added O
, O
motioning O
to O
me O
with O
his O
tomahawk O
, O
and O
throwing O
the O
clothes O
to O
one O
side O
. O
He O
really O
did O
this O
in O
not O
only O
a O
civil O
but O
a O
really O
kind O
and O
charitable O
way O
. O
I O
stood O
looking O
at O
him O
a O
moment O
. O
For O
all O
his O
tattooings O
he O
was O
on O
the O
whole O
a O
clean O
, O
comely O
looking O
cannibal O
. O
What O
's O
all O
this O
fuss O
I O
have O
been O
making O
about O

I O
to O
myself O

: O

just O

much O
reason O
to O

, O
as O
I O
have O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
him O

Better O
sleep O
with O
a O
sober O
cannibal O
than O
a O
drunken O
Christian O
. O
`` O

said O
I O

`` O

But O
I O
do O
