|A yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air . |	Buck Mulligan									
|He held the bowl aloft and intoned : -- Introibo ad altare Dei . |	DEFAULT									
|Halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : -- Come up , Kinch ! |	DEFAULT	Kinch								
|Come up , you fearful jesuit ! |	Kinch									
|Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest . |	DEFAULT									
|He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains . |	DEFAULT									
|Then , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head . |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT								
|Stephen Dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- Back to barracks ! |										
|he said sternly . |	DEFAULT									
|He added in a preacher 's tone : -- For this , O dearly beloved , is the genuine Christine : body and soul and blood and ouns . |	DEFAULT	Christine								
|Slow music , please . |										
|Shut your eyes , gents . |										
|One moment . |										
|A little trouble about those white corpuscles . |										
|Silence , all . |										
|He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points . |	DEFAULT									
|Chrysostomos . |										
|Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm . |										
|-- Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly . |	DEFAULT									
|That will do nicely . |										
|Switch off the current , will you ? |	DEFAULT									
|He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown . |	DEFAULT									
|The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages . |										
|A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips . |	DEFAULT									
|-- The mockery of it ! |										
|he said gaily . |	DEFAULT									
|Your absurd name , an ancient Greek ! |	DEFAULT									
|He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself . |	DEFAULT									
|Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck . |	Stephen Dedalus	Buck Mulligan								
|Buck Mulligan 's gay voice went on . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- My name is absurd too : Malachi Mulligan , two dactyls . |	Malachi Mulligan									
|But it has a Hellenic ring , has n't it ? |										
|Tripping and sunny like the buck himself . |	DEFAULT									
|We must go to Athens . |										
|Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried : -- Will he come ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The jejune jesuit ! |										
|Ceasing , he began to shave with care . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- Tell me , Mulligan , Stephen said quietly . |	Buck Mulligan	Stephen Dedalus								
|-- Yes , my love ? |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- How long is Haines going to stay in this tower ? |	Haines									
|Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- God , is n't he dreadful ? |	DEFAULT									
|he said frankly . |	DEFAULT									
|A ponderous Saxon . |										
|He thinks you 're not a gentleman . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|God , these bloody English ! |										
|Bursting with money and indigestion . |										
|Because he comes from Oxford . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|You know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|He ca n't make you out . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|O , my name for you is the best : Kinch , the knife-blade . |	DEFAULT	Kinch								
|He shaved warily over his chin . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- He was raving all night about a black panther , Stephen said . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|Where is his guncase ? |	DEFAULT									
|-- A woful lunatic ! |										
|Mulligan said . |	Buck Mulligan									
|Were you in a funk ? |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- I was , Stephen said with energy and growing fear . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Out here in the dark with a man I do n't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther . |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT								
|You saved men from drowning . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm not a hero , however . |	DEFAULT									
|If he stays on here I am off . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade . |	Buck Mulligan									
|He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- Scutter ! |										
|he cried thickly . |	DEFAULT									
|He came over to the gunrest and , thrusting a hand into Stephen 's upper pocket , said : -- Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor . |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT								
|Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief . |	Stephen Dedalus	Buck Mulligan								
|Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly . |	Buck Mulligan									
|Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : -- The bard 's noserag ! |	Buck Mulligan									
|A new art colour for our Irish poets : snotgreen . |										
|You can almost taste it , ca n't you ? |	DEFAULT									
|He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly . |	DEFAULT									
|-- God ! |										
|he said quietly . |	DEFAULT									
|Is n't the sea what Algy calls it : a great sweet mother ? |	Algy									
|The snotgreen sea . |										
|The scrotumtightening sea . |										
|Epi oinopa ponton . |										
|Ah , Dedalus , the Greeks ! |	Stephen Dedalus									
|I must teach you . |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT								
|You must read them in the original . |	DEFAULT									
|Thalatta ! |										
|Thalatta ! |										
|She is our great sweet mother . |	DEFAULT									
|Come and look . |										
|Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- Our mighty mother ! |										
|Buck Mulligan said . |	Buck Mulligan									
|He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen 's face . |	Buck Mulligan	Stephen Dedalus								
|-- The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|That 's why she wo n't let me have anything to do with you . |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|-- Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|-- You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said . |	Kinch	Buck Mulligan								
|I 'm hyperborean as much as you . |	Buck Mulligan	Kinch								
|But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|And you refused . |	DEFAULT									
|There is something sinister in you ... He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|A tolerant smile curled his lips . |	DEFAULT									
|-- But a lovely mummer ! |										
|he murmured to himself . |	DEFAULT									
|Kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all ! |	Kinch									
|He shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously . |	Kinch									
|Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart . |										
|Silently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him . |	DEFAULT									
|The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid . |										
|A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting . |	DEFAULT									
|Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- Ah , poor dogsbody ! |										
|he said in a kind voice . |	DEFAULT									
|I must give you a shirt and a few noserags . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|How are the secondhand breeks ? |										
|-- They fit well enough , Stephen answered . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- The mockery of it , he said contentedly . |	Buck Mulligan									
|Secondleg they should be . |										
|God knows what poxy bowsy left them off . |										
|I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey . |	DEFAULT									
|You 'll look spiffing in them . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm not joking , Kinch . |	DEFAULT	Kinch								
|You look damn well when you 're dressed . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- Thanks , Stephen said . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|I ca n't wear them if they are grey . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- He ca n't wear them , Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror . |	DEFAULT	Buck Mulligan								
|Etiquette is etiquette . |										
|He kills his mother but he ca n't wear grey trousers . |	DEFAULT									
|He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- That fellow I was with in the Ship last night , said Buck Mulligan , says you have g. p. i. He 's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman . |	Buck Mulligan	Stephen Dedalus	Connolly Norman							
|General paralysis of the insane ! |										
|He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea . |	DEFAULT									
|His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth . |	DEFAULT									
|Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk . |	DEFAULT									
|-- Look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard ! |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT								
|Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Hair on end . |										
|As he and others see me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Who chose this face for me ? |	DEFAULT									
|This dogsbody to rid of vermin . |										
|It asks me too . |	DEFAULT									
|-- I pinched it out of the skivvy 's room , Buck Mulligan said . |	Buck Mulligan									
|It does her all right . |	DEFAULT									
|The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi . |	DEFAULT									
|Lead him not into temptation . |	DEFAULT									
|And her name is Ursula . |	Ursula									
|Laughing again , he brought the mirror away from Stephen 's peering eyes . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|-- The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said . |	Caliban	DEFAULT								
|If Wilde were only alive to see you ! |	Wilde	Stephen Dedalus								
|Drawing back and pointing , Stephen said with bitterness : -- It is a symbol of Irish art . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|The cracked lookingglass of a servant . |										
|Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen 's and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them . |	Buck Mulligan	Stephen Dedalus								
|-- It 's not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ? |	Kinch									
|he said kindly . |	DEFAULT									
|God knows you have more spirit than any of them . |	DEFAULT									
|Parried again . |										
|He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his . |	DEFAULT									
|The cold steel pen . |										
|-- Cracked lookingglass of a servant ! |										
|Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea . |	DEFAULT									
|He 's stinking with money and thinks you 're not a gentleman . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other . |	DEFAULT									
|God , Kinch , if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island . |	Kinch	DEFAULT								
|Hellenise it . |										
|Cranly 's arm . |	Cranly									
|His arm . |	Cranly									
|-- And to think of your having to beg from these swine . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm the only one that knows what you are . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Why do n't you trust me more ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What have you up your nose against me ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Is it Haines ? |	Haines									
|If he makes any noise here I 'll bring down Seymour and we 'll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe . |	Haines	DEFAULT	Seymour	Clive Kempthorpe						
|Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe 's rooms . |	Clive Kempthorpe									
|Palefaces : they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another . |										
|O , I shall expire ! |	DEFAULT									
|Break the news to her gently , Aubrey ! |	DEFAULT	Aubrey								
|I shall die ! |	DEFAULT									
|With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor 's shears . |	DEFAULT									
|A scared calf 's face gilded with marmalade . |										
|I do n't want to be debagged ! |	DEFAULT									
|Do n't you play the giddy ox with me ! |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle . |										
|A deaf gardener , aproned , masked with Matthew Arnold 's face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms . |	Matthew Arnold									
|To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos . |										
|-- Let him stay , Stephen said . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|There 's nothing wrong with him except at night . |	DEFAULT									
|-- Then what is it ? |										
|Buck Mulligan asked impatiently . |	Buck Mulligan									
|Cough it up . |										
|I 'm quite frank with you . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What have you against me now ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They halted , looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale . |										
|Stephen freed his arm quietly . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- Do you wish me to tell you ? |	Stephen Dedalus	DEFAULT								
|he asked . |	DEFAULT									
|-- Yes , what is it ? |										
|Buck Mulligan answered . |	Buck Mulligan									
|I do n't remember anything . |	Buck Mulligan									
|He looked in Stephen 's face as he spoke . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|A light wind passed his brow , fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes . |	DEFAULT									
|Stephen , depressed by his own voice , said : -- Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother 's death ? |	Stephen Dedalus	Buck Mulligan								
|Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said : -- What ? |	Buck Mulligan									
|Where ? |										
|I ca n't remember anything . |	DEFAULT									
|I remember only ideas and sensations . |	DEFAULT									
|Why ? |										
|What happened in the name of God ? |										
|-- You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water . |	DEFAULT	Stephen Dedalus								
|Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom . |	DEFAULT									
|She asked you who was in your room . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|-- Yes ? |										
|Buck Mulligan said . |	Buck Mulligan									
|What did I say ? |	Buck Mulligan									
|I forget . |	DEFAULT									
|-- You said , Stephen answered , O , it 's only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead . |	Stephen Dedalus	Buck Mulligan								
|A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan 's cheek . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- Did I say that ? |	Buck Mulligan									
|he asked . |	DEFAULT									
|Well ? |										
|What harm is that ? |										
|He shook his constraint from him nervously . |	DEFAULT									
|-- And what is death , he asked , your mother 's or yours or my own ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|You saw only your mother die . |	DEFAULT									
|I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom . |	DEFAULT									
|It 's a beastly thing and nothing else . |										
|It simply does n't matter . |										
|You would n't kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Why ? |										
|Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it 's injected the wrong way . |	DEFAULT									
|To me it 's all a mockery and beastly . |	DEFAULT									
|Her cerebral lobes are not functioning . |	DEFAULT									
|She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt . |	DEFAULT	Peter Teazle								
|Humour her till it 's over . |	DEFAULT									
|You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I do n't whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette 's . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|Absurd ! |										
|I suppose I did say it . |	DEFAULT									
|I did n't mean to offend the memory of your mother . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He had spoken himself into boldness . |	DEFAULT									
|Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : -- I am not thinking of the offence to my mother . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|-- Of what then ? |										
|Buck Mulligan asked . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- Of the offence to me , Stephen answered . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel . |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- O , an impossible person ! |										
|he exclaimed . |	DEFAULT									
|He walked off quickly round the parapet . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Sea and headland now grew dim . |										
|Pulses were beating in his eyes , veiling their sight , and he felt the fever of his cheeks . |	Buck Mulligan									
|A voice within the tower called loudly : -- Are you up there , Mulligan ? |	Buck Mulligan									
|-- I 'm coming , Buck Mulligan answered . |	Buck Mulligan									
|He turned towards Stephen and said : -- Look at the sea . |	Buck Mulligan	Stephen Dedalus								
|What does it care about offences ? |										
|Chuck Loyola , Kinch , and come on down . |	Chuck Loyola	Kinch								
|The Sassenach wants his morning rashers . |										
|His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase , level with the roof : -- Do n't mope over it all day , he said . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm inconsequent . |	DEFAULT									
|Give up the moody brooding . |										
|His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead : And no more turn aside and brood Upon love 's bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars . |	DEFAULT	Fergus								
|Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed . |	DEFAULT									
|Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet . |										
|White breast of the dim sea . |										
|The twining stresses , two by two . |										
|A hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords . |										
|Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide . |										
|A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green . |										
|It lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters . |	DEFAULT									
|Fergus ' song : I sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords . |	Fergus	DEFAULT								
|Her door was open : she wanted to hear my music . |	DEFAULT									
|Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|She was crying in her wretched bed . |	DEFAULT									
|For those words , Stephen : love 's bitter mystery . |	Stephen Dedalus									
|Where now ? |										
|Her secrets : old featherfans , tasselled dancecards , powdered with musk , a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer . |	DEFAULT									
|A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl . |	DEFAULT									
|She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang : I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility . |	DEFAULT	Royce								
|Phantasmal mirth , folded away : muskperfumed . |										
|And no more turn aside and brood . |										
|Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys . |	DEFAULT									
|Memories beset his brooding brain . |	DEFAULT									
|Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament . |	DEFAULT									
|A cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening . |	DEFAULT									
|Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children 's shirts . |	DEFAULT									
|In a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Her glazing eyes , staring out of death , to shake and bend my soul . |	DEFAULT									
|On me alone . |	DEFAULT									
|The ghostcandle to light her agony . |	DEFAULT									
|Ghostly light on the tortured face . |										
|Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees . |	DEFAULT									
|Her eyes on me to strike me down . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet : iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat . |										
|Ghoul ! |										
|Chewer of corpses ! |										
|No , mother ! |										
|Let me be and let me live . |	DEFAULT									
|-- Kinch ahoy ! |	Kinch									
|Buck Mulligan 's voice sang from within the tower . |	Buck Mulligan
