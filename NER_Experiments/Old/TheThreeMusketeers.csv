0.021189921404628	88	|But at the same moment , his two auditors , accompanied by the host , fell upon dâ€™Artagnan with sticks , shovels and tongs . |	|This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that dâ€™Artagnan 's adversary , while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows , sheathed his sword with the same precision , and instead of an actor , which he had nearly been , became a spectator of the fight -- a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness , muttering , nevertheless , `` A plague upon these Gascons ! |	|Replace him on his orange horse , and let him begone !

0.504385461864651	64	|Unfortunately , as he advanced , his anger increased at every step ; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge , he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality , which he accompanied with a furious gesture . |	|`` I say , sir , you sir , who are hiding yourself behind that shutter -- yes , you , sir , tell me what you are laughing at , and we will laugh together ! '' |	|The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier , as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed ; then , when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter , his eyebrows slightly bent , and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described , he replied to dâ€™Artagnan , `` I was not speaking to you , sir .

0.989349212563547	166	|He perceived then , at a glance , that this woman was young and beautiful ; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which dâ€™Artagnan had hitherto resided . |	|She was pale and fair , with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders , had large , blue , languishing eyes , rosy lips , and hands of alabaster . |	|She was talking with great animation with the stranger . |	1	DEFAULT

0.791872071021116	261	|This chamber was a sort of garret , situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs , near the Luxembourg . |	|As soon as the earnest money was paid , dâ€™Artagnan took possession of his lodging , and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost-new doublet of the elder M. dâ€™Artagnan , and which she had given her son secretly . |	|Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new blade put to his sword , and then returned toward the Louvre , inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hotel of M. de Treville , which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier ; that is to say , in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by dâ€™Artagnan -- a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey . |	2	M. dâ€™Artagnan	DEFAULT

'' |	|Unfortunately , there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat ; which was , as we have related , that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two , and which he had entirely forgotten . |	|Hence , it resulted when dâ€™Artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest , he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length , which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard . |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan									
0.753102895125647	42	|Upon which M. dâ€™Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son , kissed him tenderly on both cheeks , and gave him his benediction . |	|On leaving the paternal chamber , the young man found his mother , who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment . |	|The adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other -- not that M. dâ€™Artagnan did not love his son , who was his only offspring , but M. dâ€™Artagnan was a man , and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings ; whereas Mme. dâ€™Artagnan was a woman , and still more , a mother . |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan									
0.103637008857821	57	|He fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger , and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five years of age , with black and piercing eyes , pale complexion , a strongly marked nose , and a black and well-shaped mustache . |	|He was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color , with aiguillettes of the same color , without any other ornaments than the customary slashes , through which the shirt appeared . |	|This doublet and hose , though new , were creased , like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.213768579251464	46	|The same day the young man set forward on his journey , furnished with the three paternal gifts , which consisted , as we have said , of fifteen crowns , the horse , and the letter for M. de Treville -- the counsels being thrown into the bargain . |	|With such a VADE MECUM dâ€™Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes , to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait . |	|Don Quixote took windmills for giants , and sheep for armies ; dâ€™Artagnan took every smile for an insult , and every look as a provocation -- whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was constantly doubled , or his hand on the hilt of his sword ; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw , nor did the sword issue from its scabbard . |	2	M. dâ€™Artagnan	Cervantes

0.491464843143357	196	|`` He is a coward , indeed , '' grumbled the host , drawing near to dâ€™Artagnan , and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man , as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before . |	|`` Yes , a base coward , '' murmured dâ€™Artagnan ; `` but she -- she was very beautiful . '' |	|`` What she ? '' |	2	M. dâ€™Artagnan	DEFAULT								
0.776905264559546	116	|`` Oh , no , your Excellency , he is not the devil , '' replied the host , with a grin of contempt ; `` for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns -- which however , did not prevent his saying , as he was fainting , that if such a thing had happened in Paris , you should have cause to repent of it at a later period .

0.195355308486231	238	|A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing . |	|`` That letter is not lost ! '' |	|cried he . |	0										
0.82205686257863	157	|I should like , however , to know what this letter addressed to Treville contains . '' |	|_ * We are well aware that this term , milady , is only properly used when followed by a family name . |	|But we find it thus in the manuscript , and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it . |	2	DEFAULT	Milady								
0.334243886624295	264	|After this , satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at Meung , without remorse for the past , confident in the present , and full of hope for the future , he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave . |	|This sleep , provincial as it was , brought him to nine oâ€™clock in the morning ; at which hour he rose , in order to repair to the residence of M. de Treville , the third personage in the kingdom , in the paternal estimation . |	|2 THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TREVILLE M de Troisville , as his family was still called in Gascony , or M. de Treville , as he has ended by styling himself in Paris , had really commenced life as dâ€™Artagnan now did ; that is to say , without a sou in his pocket , but with a fund of audacity , shrewdness , and intelligence which makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his . |	2	M. dâ€™Artagnan	Monsieur de Treville								
0.210668842774939	81	|`` Strike me ! '' |	|said the other , turning on his heels , and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt . |	|`` Why , my good fellow , you must be mad ! '' |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.700476304489541	104	|`` Well , how is it with this madman ? '' |	|exclaimed he , turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host , who came in to inquire if he was unhurt . |	|`` Your excellency is safe and sound ? '' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.060183911826803	1	|1 THE THREE PRESENTS OF Dâ€™ARTAGNAN THE ELDER On the first Monday of the month of April , 1625 , the market town of Meung , in which the author of ROMANCE OF THE ROSE was born , appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made a second La Rochelle of it . |	|Many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the High Street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the Jolly Miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity . |	|In those times panics were common , and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind . |	1	Jolly Miller									
0.807884477495711	68	|replied the young man , additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners , of politeness and scorn . |	|The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile , and retiring from the window , came out of the hostelry with a slow step , and placed himself before the horse , within two paces of dâ€™Artagnan . |	|His quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking , and who still remained at the window . |	2	DEFAULT	M. dâ€™Artagnan								
0.406643525204446	54	|The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors ; and , as I have said , the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator , they every moment burst into fits of laughter . |	|Now , as a half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man , the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined . |	|Nevertheless , dâ€™Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.519864442105472	208	|`` My letter of recommendation ! '' |	|cried dâ€™Artagnan , `` my letter of recommendation ! |	|or , the holy blood , I will spit you all like ortolans ! '' |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan									
0.234068690381829	39	|Still further , Monsieur de Treville gains ten thousand crowns a year ; he is therefore a great noble . |	|He began as you begin . |	|Go to him with this letter , and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done . '' |	2	Monsieur de Treville	DEFAULT								
0.526328353142123	119	|`` Did he name no one in his passion ? '' |	|`` Yes ; he struck his pocket and said , ` We shall see what Monsieur de Treville will think of this insult offered to his protege . |	|''' `` Monsieur de Treville ? '' |	2	DEFAULT	Monsieur de Treville

0.241676870646957	240	|cried he . |	|`` What ! '' |	|cried dâ€™Artagnan . |	0										
0.619749799387806	83	|`` Why , my good fellow , you must be mad ! '' |	|Then , in a suppressed tone , as if speaking to himself , `` This is annoying , '' continued he . |	|`` What a godsend this would be for his Majesty , who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his Musketeers ! '' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.469484452192234	234	|`` But it 's of no importance , '' continued dâ€™Artagnan , with natural assurance ; `` it 's of no importance . |	|The money is nothing ; that letter was everything . |	|I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it . '' |	0										
0.082497577699784	51	|But there , as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly Miller , without anyone -- host , waiter , or hostler -- coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse , dâ€™Artagnan spied , though an open window on the ground floor , a gentleman , well-made and of good carriage , although of rather a stern countenance , talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect . |	|Dâ€™Artagnan fancied quite naturally , according to his custom , that he must be the object of their conversation , and listened . |	|This time dâ€™Artagnan was only in part mistaken ; he himself was not in question , but his horse was . |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan									
0.127562883585121	153	|But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short ; he bowed humbly and retired . |	|`` It is not necessary for Milady * to be seen by this fellow , '' continued the stranger . |	|`` She will soon pass ; she is already late . |	3	Milady	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
0.185229814225473	249	|I would lay a wager he has stolen it . '' |	|`` Do you think so ? '' |	|answered dâ€™Artagnan , but little convinced , as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was , and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.929936034428584	173	|`` They are contained in this box , which you will not open until you are on the other side of the Channel . '' |	|`` Very well ; and you -- what will you do ? '' |	|`` I -- I return to Paris . '' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.749705135760124	20	|At court , provided you have ever the honor to go there , '' continued M. dâ€™Artagnan the elder , `` -- an honor to which , remember , your ancient nobility gives you the right -- sustain worthily your name of gentleman , which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years , both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you . |	|By the latter I mean your relatives and friends . |	|Endure nothing from anyone except Monsieur the Cardinal and the king . |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan									
0.643937004618531	211	|Unfortunately , there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat ; which was , as we have related , that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two , and which he had entirely forgotten . |	|Hence , it resulted when dâ€™Artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest , he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length , which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard . |	|As to the rest of the blade , the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin . |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan									
0.435376497704615	221	|There was , to be sure , Father Joseph , but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice , such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence , as the cardinal 's familiar was called . |	|Throwing down his spit , and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle , and the servants with their sticks , he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter . |	|`` Does the letter contain anything valuable ?

0.875602226610945	76	|`` And I , '' cried dâ€™Artagnan , `` will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me !

0.471998470948657	217	|cried dâ€™Artagnan . |	|`` In the first place , I warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Treville , and it must be found , or if it is not found , he will know how to find it . '' |	|His threat completed the intimidation of the host . |	2	M. dâ€™Artagnan	Monsieur de Treville								
0.470894483470105	24	|Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him . |	|You are young . |	|You ought to be brave for two reasons : the first is that you are a Gascon , and the second is that you are my son . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.503338552017769	186	|The two interlocutors thus separated , taking opposite directions , at full gallop . |	|`` Pay him , booby !

0.332279584406102	40	|He began as you begin . |	|Go to him with this letter , and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done .

0.018458964897462	122	|said the stranger , becoming attentive , `` he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of Monsieur de Treville ? |	|Now , my dear host , while your young man was insensible , you did not fail , I am quite sure , to ascertain what that pocket contained . |	|What was there in it ?

0.214754603144214	259	|Thus the dealer to whom dâ€™Artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color . |	|Thus dâ€™Artagnan entered Paris on foot , carrying his little packet under his arm , and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means . |	|This chamber was a sort of garret , situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs , near the Luxembourg . |	1	M. dâ€™Artagnan
