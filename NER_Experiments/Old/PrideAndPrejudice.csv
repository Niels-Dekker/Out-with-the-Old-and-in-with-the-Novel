0.281834355450792	136	|The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud ; to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . |	|Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . |	|Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . |	1	Mr. Bingley

0.351140449870272	235	|Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . |	|They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it , but proud and conceited . |	|They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank , and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . |	0

0.07673353863781	240	|Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . |	|His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but , though he was now only established as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table -- nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . |	|Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . |	4	Mr. Bingley	Miss Elizabeth Bennet	Mrs. Hurst	Mr. Hurst

0.167024587940116	252	|The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . |	|Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and , as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . |	|Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . |	2	Mr. Bingley	Miss Elizabeth Bennet
