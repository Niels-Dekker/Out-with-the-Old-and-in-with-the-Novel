Buck did not read the newspapers , or he would have known that trouble was brewing , not alone for himself , but for every tide-water dog , strong of muscle and with warm , long hair , from Puget Sound to San Diego . 
Because men , groping in the Arctic darkness , had found a yellow metal , and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find , thousands of men were rushing into the Northland . 
These men wanted dogs , and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs , with strong muscles by which to toil , and furry coats to protect them from the frost . 
Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley . 
Judge Miller 's place , it was called . 
It stood back from the road , half hidden among the trees , through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides . 
The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars . 
At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front . 
There were great stables , where a dozen grooms and boys held forth , rows of vine-clad servants ' cottages , an endless and orderly array of outhouses , long grape arbors , green pastures , orchards , and berry patches . 
Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well , and the big cement tank where Judge Miller 's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon . 
And over this great demesne Buck ruled . 
Here he was born , and here he had lived the four years of his life . 
It was true , there were other dogs , There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place , but they did not count . 
They came and went , resided in the populous kennels , or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots , the Japanese pug , or Ysabel , the Mexican hairless , -- strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground . 
On the other hand , there were the fox terriers , a score of them at least , who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops . 
But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog . 
The whole realm was his . 
He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge 's sons ; he escorted Mollie and Alice , the Judge 's daughters , on long twilight or early morning rambles ; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge 's feet before the roaring library fire ; he carried the Judge 's grandsons on his back , or rolled them in the grass , and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard , and even beyond , where the paddocks were , and the berry patches . 
Among the terriers he stalked imperiously , and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored , for he was king , -- king over all creeping , crawling , flying things of Judge Miller 's place , humans included . 
His father , Elmo , a huge St. Bernard , had been the Judge 's inseparable companion , and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father . 
He was not so large , -- he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds , -- for his mother , Shep , had been a Scotch shepherd dog . 
Nevertheless , one hundred and forty pounds , to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect , enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion . 
During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat ; he had a fine pride in himself , was even a trifle egotistical , as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation . 
But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog . 
Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles ; and to him , as to the cold-tubbing races , the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver . 
And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897 , when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North . 
But Buck did not read the newspapers , and he did not know that Manuel , one of the gardener 's helpers , was an undesirable acquaintance . 
Manuel had one besetting sin . 
He loved to play Chinese lottery . 
Also , in his gambling , he had one besetting weakness -- faith in a system ; and this made his damnation certain . 
For to play a system requires money , while the wages of a gardener 's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny . 
The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers ' Association , and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club , on the memorable night of Manuel 's treachery . 
No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll . 
And with the exception of a solitary man , no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park . 
This man talked with Manuel , and money chinked between them . 
`` You might wrap up the goods before you deliver ` m , '' the stranger said gruffly , and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck 's neck under the collar . 
`` Twist it , an ' you 'll choke ` m plentee , '' said Manuel , and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative . 
Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity . 
To be sure , it was an unwonted performance : but he had learned to trust in men he knew , and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own . 
But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger 's hands , he growled menacingly . 
He had merely intimated his displeasure , in his pride believing that to intimate was to command . 
But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck , shutting off his breath . 
In quick rage he sprang at the man , who met him halfway , grappled him close by the throat , and with a deft twist threw him over on his back . 
Then the rope tightened mercilessly , while Buck struggled in a fury , his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely . 
Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated , and never in all his life had he been so angry . 
But his strength ebbed , his eyes glazed , and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car . 
The next he knew , he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance . 
The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was . 
He had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car . 
He opened his eyes , and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king . 
The man sprang for his throat , but Buck was too quick for him . 
His jaws closed on the hand , nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more . 
`` Yep , has fits , '' the man said , hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman , who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle . 
`` I 'm takin ' ` m up for the boss to ` Frisco . 
A crack dog-doctor there thinks that he can cure ` m. '' Concerning that night 's ride , the man spoke most eloquently for himself , in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front . 
`` All I get is fifty for it , '' he grumbled ; `` an ' I would n't do it over for a thousand , cold cash . '' 
His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief , and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle . 
`` How much did the other mug get ? '' 
the saloon-keeper demanded . 
`` A hundred , '' was the reply . 
`` Would n't take a sou less , so help me . '' 
`` That makes a hundred and fifty , '' the saloon-keeper calculated ; `` and he 's worth it , or I 'm a squarehead . '' 
The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand . 
`` If I do n't get the hydrophoby -- '' `` It 'll be because you was born to hang , '' laughed the saloon-keeper . 
`` Here , lend me a hand before you pull your freight , '' he added . 
Dazed , suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue , with the life half throttled out of him , Buck attempted to face his tormentors . 
But he was thrown down and choked repeatedly , till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck . 
Then the rope was removed , and he was flung into a cagelike crate . 
There he lay for the remainder of the weary night , nursing his wrath and wounded pride . 
He could not understand what it all meant . 
What did they want with him , these strange men ? 
Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate ? 
He did not know why , but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity . 
Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open , expecting to see the Judge , or the boys at least . 
But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle . 
And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck 's throat was twisted into a savage growl . 
But the saloon-keeper let him alone , and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate . 
More tormentors , Buck decided , for they were evil-looking creatures , ragged and unkempt ; and he stormed and raged at them through the bars . 
They only laughed and poked sticks at him , which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted . 
Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon . 
Then he , and the crate in which he was imprisoned , began a passage through many hands . 
Clerks in the express office took charge of him ; he was carted about in another wagon ; a truck carried him , with an assortment of boxes and parcels , upon a ferry steamer ; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot , and finally he was deposited in an express car . 
For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives ; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank . 
In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls , and they had retaliated by teasing him . 
When he flung himself against the bars , quivering and frothing , they laughed at him and taunted him . 
They growled and barked like detestable dogs , mewed , and flapped their arms and crowed . 
It was all very silly , he knew ; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity , and his anger waxed and waxed . 
He did not mind the hunger so much , but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch . 
For that matter , high-strung and finely sensitive , the ill treatment had flung him into a fever , which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue . 
He was glad for one thing : the rope was off his neck . 
That had given them an unfair advantage ; but now that it was off , he would show them . 
They would never get another rope around his neck . 
Upon that he was resolved . 
For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank , and during those two days and nights of torment , he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him . 
His eyes turned blood-shot , and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend . 
So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him ; and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle . 
Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small , high-walled back yard . 
A stout man , with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck , came out and signed the book for the driver . 
That was the man , Buck divined , the next tormentor , and he hurled himself savagely against the bars . 
The man smiled grimly , and brought a hatchet and a club . 
`` You ai n't going to take him out now ? '' 
the driver asked . 
`` Sure , '' the man replied , driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry . 
There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in , and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance . 
Buck rushed at the splintering wood , sinking his teeth into it , surging and wrestling with it . 
Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside , he was there on the inside , snarling and growling , as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out . 
`` Now , you red-eyed devil , '' he said , when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck 's body . 
At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand . 
And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil , as he drew himself together for the spring , hair bristling , mouth foaming , a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes . 
Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury , surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights . 
In mid air , just as his jaws were about to close on the man , he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip . 
He whirled over , fetching the ground on his back and side . 
He had never been struck by a club in his life , and did not understand . 
With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air . 
And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground . 
This time he was aware that it was the club , but his madness knew no caution . 
A dozen times he charged , and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down . 
After a particularly fierce blow , he crawled to his feet , too dazed to rush . 
He staggered limply about , the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears , his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver . 
Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose . 
All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this . 
With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity , he again hurled himself at the man . 
But the man , shifting the club from right to left , coolly caught him by the under jaw , at the same time wrenching downward and backward . 
Buck described a complete circle in the air , and half of another , then crashed to the ground on his head and chest . 
For the last time he rushed . 
The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long , and Buck crumpled up and went down , knocked utterly senseless . 
`` He 's no slouch at dog-breakin ' , that 's wot I say , '' one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically . 
`` Druther break cayuses any day , and twice on Sundays , '' was the reply of the driver , as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses . 
Buck 's senses came back to him , but not his strength . 
He lay where he had fallen , and from there he watched the man in the red sweater . 
``` Answers to the name of Buck , ''' the man soliloquized , quoting from the saloon-keeper 's letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents . 
`` Well , Buck , my boy , '' he went on in a genial voice , `` we 've had our little ruction , and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that . 
You 've learned your place , and I know mine . 
Be a good dog and all ` ll go well and the goose hang high . 
Be a bad dog , and I 'll whale the stuffin ' outa you . 
Understand ? '' 
As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded , and though Buck 's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand , he endured it without protest . 
When the man brought him water he drank eagerly , and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat , chunk by chunk , from the man 's hand . 
He was beaten -LRB- he knew that -RRB- ; but he was not broken . 
He saw , once for all , that he stood no chance against a man with a club . 
He had learned the lesson , and in all his after life he never forgot it . 
That club was a revelation . 
It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law , and he met the introduction halfway . 
The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect ; and while he faced that aspect uncowed , he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused . 
As the days went by , other dogs came , in crates and at the ends of ropes , some docilely , and some raging and roaring as he had come ; and , one and all , he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater . 
Again and again , as he looked at each brutal performance , the lesson was driven home to Buck : a man with a club was a lawgiver , a master to be obeyed , though not necessarily conciliated . 
Of this last Buck was never guilty , though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man , and wagged their tails , and licked his hand . 
Also he saw one dog , that would neither conciliate nor obey , finally killed in the struggle for mastery . 
Now and again men came , strangers , who talked excitedly , wheedlingly , and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater . 
And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them . 
Buck wondered where they went , for they never came back ; but the fear of the future was strong upon him , and he was glad each time when he was not selected . 
Yet his time came , in the end , in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand . 
`` Sacredam ! '' 
he cried , when his eyes lit upon Buck . 
`` Dat one dam bully dog ! 
Eh ? 
How moch ? '' 
`` Three hundred , and a present at that , '' was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater . 
`` And seem ' it 's government money , you ai n't got no kick coming , eh , Perrault ? '' 
Perrault grinned . 
Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand , it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal . 
The Canadian Government would be no loser , nor would its despatches travel the slower . 
Perrault knew dogs , and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand -- `` One in ten t ' ousand , '' he commented mentally . 
Buck saw money pass between them , and was not surprised when Curly , a good-natured Newfoundland , and he were led away by the little weazened man . 
That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater , and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal , it was the last he saw of the warm Southland . 
Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois . 
Perrault was a French-Canadian , and swarthy ; but Francois was a French-Canadian half-breed , and twice as swarthy . 
They were a new kind of men to Buck -LRB- of which he was destined to see many more -RRB- , and while he developed no affection for them , he none the less grew honestly to respect them . 
He speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair men , calm and impartial in administering justice , and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs . 
In the ` tween-decks of the Narwhal , Buck and Curly joined two other dogs . 
One of them was a big , snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain , and who had later accompanied a Geological Survey into the Barrens . 
He was friendly , in a treacherous sort of way , smiling into one 's face the while he meditated some underhand trick , as , for instance , when he stole from Buck 's food at the first meal . 
As Buck sprang to punish him , the lash of Francois 's whip sang through the air , reaching the culprit first ; and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone . 
That was fair of Francois , he decided , and the half-breed began his rise in Buck 's estimation . 
The other dog made no advances , nor received any ; also , he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers . 
He was a gloomy , morose fellow , and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone , and further , that there would be trouble if he were not left alone . 
`` Dave '' he was called , and he ate and slept , or yawned between times , and took interest in nothing , not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed . 
When Buck and Curly grew excited , half wild with fear , he raised his head as though annoyed , favored them with an incurious glance , yawned , and went to sleep again . 
Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller , and though one day was very like another , it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder . 
At last , one morning , the propeller was quiet , and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement . 
He felt it , as did the other dogs , and knew that a change was at hand . 
Francois leashed them and brought them on deck . 
At the first step upon the cold surface , Buck 's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud . 
He sprang back with a snort . 
More of this white stuff was falling through the air . 
He shook himself , but more of it fell upon him . 
He sniffed it curiously , then licked some up on his tongue . 
It bit like fire , and the next instant was gone . 
This puzzled him . 
He tried it again , with the same result . 
The onlookers laughed uproariously , and he felt ashamed , he knew not why , for it was his first snow .
