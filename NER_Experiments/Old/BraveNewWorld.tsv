|Over the main en - trance the words , CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE , and , in a shield , the World State 's motto , COMMUNITY , IDEN - TITY , STABILITY . |										
|The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north . |										
|Cold for all the summer beyond the panes , for all the tropical heat of the room itself , a harsh thin light glared through the windows , hungrily seeking some draped lay figure , some pallid shape of academic goose - flesh , but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porce - lain of a laboratory . |										
|Wintriness responded to wintriness . |										
|The overalls of the workers were white , their hands gloved with a pale corpse - coloured rubber . |										
|The light was frozen , dead , a ghost . |										
|Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance , lying along the polished tubes like butter , streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables . |										
|` And this , ' said the Director opening the door , ` is the Fertilizing Room . ' |	The Director									
|Bent over their instruments , three hundred Fertilizers were plunged , as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room , in the scarcely breathing silence , the absent-minded , soliloquizing hum or whistle , of absorbed concentration . |	The Director									
|A troop of newly arrived students , very young , pink and callow , followed nervously , rather abjectly , at the Director 's heels . |	The Director									
|Each of them carried a notebook , in which , whenever the great man spoke , he desperately scribbled . |										
|Straight from the horse 's mouth . |										
|It was a rare privilege . |										
|The D. H. C. for Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments . |	D.H.C.									
|` Just to give you a general idea , ' he would explain to them . |	D.H.C.									
|For of course some sort of general idea they must have , if they were to do their work intelligently-though as little of one , if they were to be good and happy members of society , as possible . |										
|For particulars , as every one knows , make for virtue and happiness ; generalities are intellectu - ally necessary evils . |										
|Not philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp col - lectors compose the backbone of society . |										
|` To-morrow , ' he would add , smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality , ` you 'll be settling down to serious work . |	DEFAULT									
|You wo n't have time for generalities . |	DEFAULT									
|Meanwhile ... ' Meanwhile , it was a privilege . |										
|Straight from the horse 's mouth into the notebook . |										
|The boys scribbled like mad . |										
|Tall and rather thin but upright , the Director advanced into the room . |	The Director									
|He had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth , just covered , when he was not talking , by his full , floridly curved lips . |	The Director									
|Old , young ? |										
|Thirty ? |										
|Fifty ? |										
|Fifty-five ? |										
|It was hard to say . |										
|And anyhow the question did n't arise ; in this year of stability , A. F. 632 , it did n't occur to you to ask it . ' |										
|I shall begin at the beginning , ' said the D.H.C. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks : Begin at the begin - ning . |	D.H.C.									
|` These , ' he waved his hand , ` are the incubators . ' |	D.H.C.									
|And opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test - tubes . |	DEFAULT									
|` The week 's supply of ova . |										
|Kept , ' he explained , ` at blood heat ; whereas the male gametes , ' and here he opened another door , ` they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven . |	DEFAULT									
|Full blood heat sterilizes . ' |										
|Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs . |	DEFAULT									
|Still leaning against the incubators he gave them , while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages , a brief description of the modern fertilizing process ; spoke first , of course , of its surgical introduc - tion - ` the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society , not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months ' salary ' ; continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing ; passed on to a consid - eration of optimum temperature , salinity , viscosity ; referred to the liq - uor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept ; and , leading his charges to the work tables , actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes ; how it was let out drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes ; how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities , counted and transferred to a porous receptacle ; how -LRB- and he now took them to watch the operation -RRB- this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa-at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre , he insisted ; and how , after ten minutes , the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined ; how , if any of the eggs remained unfertilized , it was again immersed , and , if necessary , yet again ; how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators ; where the Alphas and Betas re - mained until definitely bottled ; while the Gammas , Deltas and Epsilons were brought out again , after only thirty-six hours , to undergo Bo - kanovsky 's Process . |	DEFAULT									
|` Bokanovsky 's Process , ' repeated the Director , and the students un - derlined the words in their little notebooks . |	The Director									
|One egg , one embryo , one adult-normality . |										
|But a bokanovskified egg will bud , will proliferate , will divide . |										
|From eight to ninety-six buds , and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo , and every embryo into a full-sized adult . |										
|Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before . |										
|Progress . |										
|` Essentially , ' the D.H.C. concluded , ` bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development . |	D.H.C.									
|We check the normal growth and , paradoxically enough , the egg responds by budding . ' |										
|Responds by budding . |										
|The pencils were busy . |										
|He pointed . |	DEFAULT									
|On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box , another , rack-full was emerging . |										
|Machinery faintly purred . |										
|It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through , he told them . |	DEFAULT									
|Eight minutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand . |										
|A few died ; of the rest , the least susceptible divided into two ; most put out four buds ; some eight ; all were returned to the incubators , where the buds began to develop ; then , after two days , were suddenly chilled , chilled and checked . |										
|Two , four , eight , the buds in their turn budded ; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol ; consequently burgeoned again and having budded-bud out of bud out of bud-were thereafter-further arrest being generally fatal-left to develop in peace . |										
|By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos - a prodigious improvement , you will agree , on nature . |										
|Identical twins-but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days , when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide ; actually by dozens , by scores at a time . |										
|` Scores , ' the Director repeated and flung out his arms , as though he were distributing largesse . |	The Director									
|` Scores . ' |										
|But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay . |										
|` My good boy ! ' |	The Director									
|The Director wheeled sharply round on him . |	The Director	DEFAULT								
|` Ca n't you see ? |	DEFAULT									
|Ca n't you see ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|He raised a hand ; his expression was solemn . |	DEFAULT									
|` Bokanovsky 's Process is one of the major instruments of social stabil - ity ! ' |										
|Major instruments of social stability . |										
|Standard men and women ; in uniform batches . |										
|The whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg . |										
|` Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines ! ' |										
|The voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm . |										
|` You really know where you are . |	DEFAULT									
|For the first time in history . ' |										
|He quoted the planetary motto . |	DEFAULT									
|` Community , Identity , Stability . ' |										
|Grand words . |										
|` If we could bo - kanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved . ' |										
|Solved by standard Gammas , unvarying Deltas , uniform Epsilons . |										
|Mil - lions of identical twins . |										
|The principle of mass production at last applied to biology . |										
|` But , alas , ' the Director shook his head , ` we ca n't bokanovskify indefi - nitely . ' |	The Director									
|Ninety-six seemed to be the limit ; seventy-two a good average . |										
|From the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of identical twins as possible-that was the best -LRB- sadly a second best -RRB- that they could do . |										
|And even that was difficult . |										
|` For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach ma - turity . |										
|But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment , here and now . |										
|Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century-what would be the use of that ? ' |										
|Obviously , no use at all . |										
|But Podsnap 's Technique had immensely ac - celerated the process of ripening . |										
|They could make sure of at least a hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years . |										
|Fertilize and bo - kanovskify-in other words , multiply by seventy-two-and you get an average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical twins , all within two years of the same age . |										
|` And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals . ' |										
|Beckoning to a fair-haired , ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment . |										
|` Mr. Foster , ' he called . |	Mr. Foster	DEFAULT								
|The ruddy young man approached . |	DEFAULT									
|` Can you tell us the record for a single ovary , Mr. Foster ? ' |	Mr. Foster									
|` Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre , ' Mr. Foster replied with - out hesitation . |	Mr. Foster									
|He spoke very quickly , had a vivacious blue eye , and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Sixteen thousand and twelve ; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals . |										
|But of course they 've done much better , ' he rattled on , ` in some of the tropi - cal Centres . |	DEFAULT									
|Singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred ; and Mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark . |										
|But then they have unfair advantages . |										
|You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary ! |										
|It 's quite astonishing , when you 're used to working with European material . |										
|Still , ' he added , with a laugh -LRB- but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging -RRB- , ` still , we mean to beat them if we can . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm working on a wonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment . |	DEFAULT									
|Only just eighteen months old . |										
|Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already , ei - ther decanted or in embryo . |										
|And still going strong . |										
|We 'll beat them yet . ' |										
|` That 's the spirit I like ! ' |	The Director									
|cried the Director , and clapped Mr. Foster on the shoulder . |	The Director	Mr. Foster								
|` Come along with us , and give these boys the benefit of your expert knowledge . ' |	Mr. Foster									
|Mr. Foster smiled modestly . |	Mr. Foster									
|` With pleasure . ' |										
|They went . |										
|In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity . |										
|Flaps of fresh sow 's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement . |										
|Whizz and then , click ! |										
|the lift-hatches hew open ; the bottle-liner had only to reach out a hand , take the flap , insert , smooth-down , and be - fore the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the end - less band , whizz , click ! |										
|another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths , ready to be slipped into yet another bottle , the next of that slow interminable procession on the band . |										
|Next to the Liners stood the Matriculators . |										
|The procession advanced ; one by one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the larger containers ; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit , the morula dropped into place , the saline solution poured in ... and already the bottle had passed , and it was the turn of the labellers . |										
|Heredity , date of fertilization , membership of Bokanovsky Group-details were trans - ferred from test-tube to bottle . |										
|No longer anonymous , but named , identified , the procession marched slowly on ; on through an opening in the wall , slowly on into the Social Predestination Room . |										
|` Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index , ' said Mr. Foster with relish , as they entered . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Containing all the relevant information , ' added the Director . |	The Director									
|` Brought up to date every morning . ' |										
|` And co-ordinated every afternoon . ' |										
|` On the basis of which they make their calculations . ' |										
|` So many individuals , of such and such quality , ' said Mr. Foster . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Distributed in such and such quantities . ' |										
|` The optimum Decanting Rate at any given moment . ' |										
|` Unforeseen wastages promptly made good . ' |										
|` Promptly , ' repeated Mr. Foster . |	Mr. Foster									
|` If you knew the amount of overtime I had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake ! ' |	Mr. Foster	DEFAULT								
|He laughed good - humouredly and shook his head . |	DEFAULT									
|` The Predestinators send in their figures to the Fertilizers . ' |										
|` Who give them the embryos they ask for . ' |										
|` And the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail . ' |										
|` After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store . ' |										
|` Where we now proceed ourselves . ' |										
|And opening a door Mr. Foster led the way down a staircase into the basement . |	Mr. Foster									
|The temperature was still tropical . |										
|They descended into a thickening twilight . |										
|Two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar against any possible infiltration of the day . |										
|'Em bryos are like photograph film , ' said Mr. Foster waggishly , as he pushed open the second door . |	Mr. Foster									
|` They can only stand red light . ' |										
|And in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson , like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer 's afternoon . |	DEFAULT									
|The bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies , and among the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus . |										
|The hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air . |										
|` Give them a few figures , Mr. Foster , ' said the Director , who was tired of talking . |	Mr. Foster	The Director								
|Mr. Foster was only too happy to give them a few figures . |	Mr. Foster									
|Two hundred and twenty metres long , two hundred wide , ten high . |										
|He pointed upwards . |	DEFAULT									
|Like chickens drinking , the students lifted their eyes towards the distant ceiling . |										
|Three tiers of racks : ground floor level , first gallery , second gallery . |										
|The spidery steel-work of gallery above gallery faded away in all direc - tions into the dark . |										
|Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading demijohns from a moving staircase . |										
|The escalator from the Social Predestination Room . |										
|Each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks , each rack , though you could n't see it , was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty-three and a third centimetres an hour . |	DEFAULT									
|Two hundred and sixty-seven days at eight metres a day . |										
|Two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in all . |										
|One circuit of the cellar at ground level , one on the first gallery , half on the second , and on the two hundred and sixty-seventh morn - ing , daylight in the Decanting Room . |										
|Independent existence-so called . |										
|` But in the interval , ' Mr. Foster concluded , ` we 've managed to do a lot to them . |	Mr. Foster									
|Oh , a very great deal . ' |										
|His laugh was knowing and trium - phant . |	The Director									
|` That 's the spirit I like , ' said the Director once more . |	The Director									
|` Let 's walk around . |										
|You tell them everything , Mr. Foster . ' |	Mr. Foster									
|Mr. Foster duly told them . |	Mr. Foster									
|Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum . |										
|Made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed . |										
|Explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin . |										
|Told them of the corpus lu - teum extract . |										
|Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected . |										
|Spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their course . |										
|Described the artificial maternal cir - culation installed in every bottle at Metre 112 ; showed them the reser - voir of blood-surrogate , the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid mov - ing over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste product filter . |										
|Referred to the embryo 's troublesome tendency to anaemia , to the massive doses of hog 's stomach extract and foetal foal 's liver with which , in consequence , it had to be supplied . |										
|Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which , during the last two metres out of every eight , all the embryos were simultane - ously shaken into familiarity with movement . |										
|Hinted at the gravity of the so-called ` trauma of decanting , ' and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize , by a suitable training of the bottled embryo , that dangerous shock . |										
|Told them of the test for sex carried out in the neighborhood of Metre 200 . |										
|Explained the system of labelling-a T for the males , a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark , black on a white ground . |										
|` For of course , ' said Mr. Foster , ` in the vast majority of cases , fertility is merely a nuisance . |	Mr. Foster									
|One fertile ovary in twelve hundred-that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes . |										
|But we want to have a good choice . |										
|And of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety . |										
|So we allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally . |										
|The others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the rest of the course . |										
|Result : they 're decanted as freemartins-structurally quite normal -LRB- except , ' he had to admit , ` that they do have the slightest tendency to grow beards -RRB- , but sterile . |	DEFAULT									
|Guaranteed sterile . |										
|Which brings us at last , ' continued Mr. Foster , ` out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more in - teresting world of human invention . ' |	Mr. Foster									
|He rubbed his hands . |	Mr. Foster									
|For of course , they did n't content themselves with merely hatching out embryos : any cow could do that . |										
|` We also predestine and condition . |										
|We decant our babies as socialized human beings , as Alphas or Epsilons , as future sewage workers or fu - ture ... ' He was going to say ` future World controllers , ' but correcting himself , said ` future Directors of Hatcheries , ' instead . |	DEFAULT									
|The D.H.C. acknowledged the compliment with a smile . |	D.H.C.									
|They were passing Metre 320 on Rack 11 . |										
|A young Beta-Minus me - chanic was busy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing bottle . |										
|The hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he turned the nuts . |	DEFAULT									
|Down , down ... A final twist , a glance at the revolution counter , and he was done . |	DEFAULT									
|He moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Reducing the number of revolutions per minute , ' Mr. Foster explained . |	Mr. Foster									
|` The surrogate goes round slower ; therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals ; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen . |										
|Nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par . ' |										
|Again he rubbed his hands . |	DEFAULT									
|` But why do you want to keep the embryo below par ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|asked an in - genuous student . |										
|` Ass ! ' |										
|said the Director , breaking a long silence . |	The Director									
|` Has n't it occurred to you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an Epsilon heredity ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|It evidently had n't occurred to him . |	DEFAULT									
|He was covered with confusion . |	DEFAULT									
|` The lower the caste , ' said Mr. Foster , ` the shorter the oxygen . ' |	Mr. Foster									
|The first organ affected was the brain . |										
|After that the skeleton . |										
|At seventy per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs . |										
|At less than seventy eye - less monsters . |										
|` Who are no use at all , ' concluded Mr. Foster . |	Mr. Foster									
|Whereas -LRB- his voice became confidential and eager -RRB- , if they could dis - cover a technique for shortening the period of maturation what a tri - umph , what a benefaction to Society ! |	Mr. Foster									
|` Consider the horse . ' |										
|They considered it . |										
|Mature at six ; the elephant at ten . |										
|While at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature ; and is only full-grown at twenty . |										
|Hence , of course , that fruit of delayed development , the human intelligence . |										
|` But in Epsilons , ' said Mr. Foster very justly , ` we do n't need human in - telligence . ' |	Mr. Foster									
|Did n't need and did n't get it . |										
|But though the Epsilon mind was mature at ten , the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen . |										
|Long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity . |										
|If the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick , say , as a cow 's , what an enormous saving to the Community ! |										
|` Enormous ! ' |										
|murmured the students . |										
|Mr. Foster 's enthusiasm was in - fectious . |	Mr. Foster									
|He became rather technical ; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co - ordination which made men grow so slowly ; postulated a germinal mu - tation to account for it . |	Mr. Foster									
|Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone ? |										
|Could the individual Epsilon embryo be made a revert , by a suitable technique , to the normality of dogs and cows ? |										
|That was the problem . |										
|And it was all but solved . |										
|Pilkington , at Mombasa , had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full-grown at six and a half . |										
|A scientific triumph . |										
|But socially useless . |										
|Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work . |										
|And the process was an all-or-nothing one ; ei - ther you failed to modify at all , or else you modified the whole way . |										
|They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six . |										
|So far without success . |										
|Mr. Foster sighed and shook his head . |	Mr. Foster									
|Their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighborhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9 . |										
|From this point onwards Rack 9 was enclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel , interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide . |										
|` Heat conditioning , ' said Mr. Foster . |	Mr. Foster									
|Hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels . |										
|Coolness was wedded to dis - comfort in the form of hard X-rays . |										
|By the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold . |										
|They were predestined to emigrate to the tropics , to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers . |										
|Later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies . |										
|` We condition them to thrive on heat , ' concluded Mr. Foster . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it . ' |										
|` And that , ' put in the Director sententiously , ` that is the secret of hap - piness and virtue-liking what you 've got to do . |	The Director									
|All conditioning aims at that : making people like their unescapable social destiny . ' |										
|In a gap between two tunnels , a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle . |										
|The students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in si - lence . |										
|` Well , Lenina , ' said Mr. Foster , when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up . |	Lenina	Mr. Foster								
|The girl turned with a start . |	Lenina									
|One could see that , for all the lupus and the purple eyes , she was uncommonly pretty . |	DEFAULT									
|` Henry ! ' |	Henry									
|Her smile flashed redly at him-a row of coral teeth . |	DEFAULT	Henry								
|` Charming , charming , ' murmured the Director and , giving her two or three little pats , received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself . |	The Director	DEFAULT								
|` What are you giving them ? ' |										
|asked Mr. Foster , making his tone very professional . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Oh , the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness . ' |										
|` Tropical workers start being inoculated at Metre 150 , ' Mr. Foster ex - plained to the students . |	Mr. Foster									
|` The embryos still have gills . |										
|We immunize the fish against the future man 's diseases . ' |										
|Then , turning back to Lenina , ` Ten to five on the roof this afternoon , ' he said , ` as usual . ' |	Lenina	The Director								
|` Charming , ' said the Director once more , and , with a final pat , moved away after the others . |	The Director									
|On Rack 10 rows of next generation 's chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead , caustic soda , tar , chlorine . |										
|The first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundred metre mark on Rack 3 . |										
|A special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation . |										
|` To improve their sense of balance , ' Mr. Foster explained . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish job . |										
|We slacken off the circu - lation when they 're right way up , so that they 're half starved , and double the flow of surrogate when they 're upside down . |										
|They learn to associate topsy-turvydom with well-being ; in fact , they 're only truly happy when they 're standing on their heads . |										
|` And now , ' Mr. Foster went on , ` I 'd like to show you some very inter - esting conditioning for Alpha Plus Intellectuals . |	Mr. Foster									
|We have a big batch of them on Rack 5 . |										
|First Gallery level , ' he called to two boys who had started to go down to the ground floor . |	DEFAULT									
|` They 're round about Metre 900 , ' he explained . |	DEFAULT									
|` You ca n't really do any useful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails . |										
|Follow me . ' |	DEFAULT									
|But the Director had looked at his watch . |	The Director									
|` Ten to three , ' he said . |	The Director									
|` No time for the intellectual embryos , I 'm afraid . |	DEFAULT									
|We must go up to the Nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep . ' |										
|Mr. Foster was disappointed . |	Mr. Foster									
|` At least one glance at the Decanting Room , ' he pleaded . |	Mr. Foster									
|` Very well then . ' |										
|The Director smiled indulgently . |	The Director									
|` Just one glance . ' |
