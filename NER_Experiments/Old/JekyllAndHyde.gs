At O
friendly O
meetings O
, O
and O
when O
the O
wine O
was O
to O
his O
taste O
, O
something O
eminently O
human O
beaconed O
from O
his O
eye O
; O
something O
indeed O
which O
never O
found O
its O
way O
into O
his O
talk O
, O
but O
which O
spoke O
not O
only O
in O
these O
silent O
symbols O
of O
the O
after-dinner O
face O
, O
but O
more O
often O
and O
loudly O
in O
the O
acts O
of O
his O
life O
. O
He O
was O
austere O
with O
himself O
; O
drank O
gin O
when O
he O
was O
alone O
, O
to O
mortify O
a O
taste O
for O
vintages O
; O
and O
though O
he O
enjoyed O
the O
theatre O
, O
had O
not O
crossed O
the O
doors O
of O
one O
for O
twenty O
years O
. O
But O
he O
had O
an O
approved O
tolerance O
for O
others O
; O
sometimes O
wondering O
, O
almost O
with O
envy O
, O
at O
the O
high O
pressure O
of O
spirits O
involved O
in O
their O
misdeeds O
; O
and O
in O
any O
extremity O
inclined O
to O
help O
rather O
than O
to O
reprove O
. O
`` O
I O
incline O
to O
Cain I-PERSON
's O
heresy O
, O
'' O
he O
used O
to O
say O
quaintly O
: O
`` O
I O
let O
my O
brother O
go O
to O
the O
devil O
in O
his O
own O
way O
. O
'' O
In O
this O
character O
, O
it O
was O
frequently O
his O
fortune O
to O
be O
the O
last O
reputable O
acquaintance O
and O
the O
last O
good O
influence O
in O
the O
lives O
of O
downgoing O
men O
. O
And O
to O
such O
as O
these O
, O
so O
long O
as O
they O
came O
about O
his O
chambers O
, O
he O
never O
marked O
a O
shade O
of O
change O
in O
his O
demeanour O
. O
No O
doubt O
the O
feat O
was O
easy O
to O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON
; O
for O
he O
was O
undemonstrative O
at O
the O
best O
, O
and O
even O
his O
friendship O
seemed O
to O
be O
founded O
in O
a O
similar O
catholicity O
of O
good-nature O
. O
It O
is O
the O
mark O
of O
a O
modest O
man O
to O
accept O
his O
friendly O
circle O
ready-made O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
opportunity O
; O
and O
that O
was O
the O
lawyer O
's O
way O
. O
His O
friends O
were O
those O
of O
his O
own O
blood O
or O
those O
whom O
he O
had O
known O
the O
longest O
; O
his O
affections O
, O
like O
ivy O
, O
were O
the O
growth O
of O
time O
, O
they O
implied O
no O
aptness O
in O
the O
object O
. O
Hence O
, O
no O
doubt O
the O
bond O
that O
united O
him O
to O
Mr. O
Richard O
Enfield O
, O
his O
distant O
kinsman O
, O
the O
well-known O
man O
about O
town O
. O
It O
was O
a O
nut O
to O
crack O
for O
many O
, O
what O
these O
two O
could O
see O
in O
each O
other O
, O
or O
what O
subject O
they O
could O
find O
in O
common O
. O
It O
was O
reported O
by O
those O
who O
encountered O
them O
in O
their O
Sunday O
walks O
, O
that O
they O
said O
nothing O
, O
looked O
singularly O
dull O
and O
would O
hail O
with O
obvious O
relief O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
friend O
. O
For O
all O
that O
, O
the O
two O
men O
put O
the O
greatest O
store O
by O
these O
excursions O
, O
counted O
them O
the O
chief O
jewel O
of O
each O
week O
, O
and O
not O
only O
set O
aside O
occasions O
of O
pleasure O
, O
but O
even O
resisted O
the O
calls O
of O
business O
, O
that O
they O
might O
enjoy O
them O
uninterrupted O
. O
It O
chanced O
on O
one O
of O
these O
rambles O
that O
their O
way O
led O
them O
down O
a O
by-street O
in O
a O
busy O
quarter O
of O
London O
. O
The O
street O
was O
small O
and O
what O
is O
called O
quiet O
, O
but O
it O
drove O
a O
thriving O
trade O
on O
the O
weekdays O
. O
The O
inhabitants O
were O
all O
doing O
well O
, O
it O
seemed O
and O
all O
emulously O
hoping O
to O
do O
better O
still O
, O
and O
laying O
out O
the O
surplus O
of O
their O
grains O
in O
coquetry O
; O
so O
that O
the O
shop O
fronts O
stood O
along O
that O
thoroughfare O
with O
an O
air O
of O
invitation O
, O
like O
rows O
of O
smiling O
saleswomen O
. O
Even O
on O
Sunday O
, O
when O
it O
veiled O
its O
more O
florid O
charms O
and O
lay O
comparatively O
empty O
of O
passage O
, O
the O
street O
shone O
out O
in O
contrast O
to O
its O
dingy O
neighbourhood O
, O
like O
a O
fire O
in O
a O
forest O
; O
and O
with O
its O
freshly O
painted O
shutters O
, O
well-polished O
brasses O
, O
and O
general O
cleanliness O
and O
gaiety O
of O
note O
, O
instantly O
caught O
and O
pleased O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
passenger O
. O
Two O
doors O
from O
one O
corner O
, O
on O
the O
left O
hand O
going O
east O
the O
line O
was O
broken O
by O
the O
entry O
of O
a O
court O
; O
and O
just O
at O
that O
point O
a O
certain O
sinister O
block O
of O
building O
thrust O
forward O
its O
gable O
on O
the O
street O
. O
It O
was O
two O
storeys O
high O
; O
showed O
no O
window O
, O
nothing O
but O
a O
door O
on O
the O
lower O
storey O
and O
a O
blind O
forehead O
of O
discoloured O
wall O
on O
the O
upper O
; O
and O
bore O
in O
every O
feature O
, O
the O
marks O
of O
prolonged O
and O
sordid O
negligence O
. O
The O
door O
, O
which O
was O
equipped O
with O
neither O
bell O
nor O
knocker O
, O
was O
blistered O
and O
distained O
. O
Tramps O
slouched O
into O
the O
recess O
and O
struck O
matches O
on O
the O
panels O
; O
children O
kept O
shop O
upon O
the O
steps O
; O
the O
schoolboy O
had O
tried O
his O
knife O
on O
the O
mouldings O
; O
and O
for O
close O
on O
a O
generation O
, O
no O
one O
had O
appeared O
to O
drive O
away O
these O
random O
visitors O
or O
to O
repair O
their O
ravages O
. O
Mr. I-PERSON
Enfield I-PERSON
and O
the O
lawyer O
were O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
by-street O
; O
but O
when O
they O
came O
abreast O
of O
the O
entry O
, O
the O
former O
lifted O
up O
his O
cane O
and O
pointed O
. O
`` O
Did O
you O
ever O
remark O
that O
door O
? O
'' O
he O
asked O
; O
and O
when O
his O
companion O
had O
replied O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
`` O
It O
is O
connected O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
'' O
added O
he O
, O
`` O
with O
a O
very O
odd O
story O
. O
'' O
`` O
Indeed O
? O
'' O
said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
slight O
change O
of O
voice O
, O
`` O
and O
what O
was O
that O
? O
'' O
`` O
Well O
, O
it O
was O
this O
way O
, O
'' O
returned O
Mr. I-PERSON
Enfield I-PERSON
: O
`` O
I O
was O
coming O
home O
from O
some O
place O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
, O
about O
three O
oâ€™clock O
of O
a O
black O
winter O
morning O
, O
and O
my O
way O
lay O
through O
a O
part O
of O
town O
where O
there O
was O
literally O
nothing O
to O
be O
seen O
but O
lamps O
. O
Street O
after O
street O
and O
all O
the O
folks O
asleep O
-- O
street O
after O
street O
, O
all O
lighted O
up O
as O
if O
for O
a O
procession O
and O
all O
as O
empty O
as O
a O
church O
-- O
till O
at O
last O
I O
got O
into O
that O
state O
of O
mind O
when O
a O
man O
listens O
and O
listens O
and O
begins O
to O
long O
for O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
policeman O
. O
All O
at O
once O
, O
I O
saw O
two O
figures O
: O
one O
a O
little O
man O
who O
was O
stumping O
along O
eastward O
at O
a O
good O
walk O
, O
and O
the O
other O
a O
girl O
of O
maybe O
eight O
or O
ten O
who O
was O
running O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
was O
able O
down O
a O
cross O
street O
. O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O
the O
two O
ran O
into O
one O
another O
naturally O
enough O
at O
the O
corner O
; O
and O
then O
came O
the O
horrible O
part O
of O
the O
thing O
; O
for O
the O
man O
trampled O
calmly O
over O
the O
child O
's O
body O
and O
left O
her O
screaming O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
It O
sounds O
nothing O
to O
hear O
, O
but O
it O
was O
hellish O
to O
see O
. O
It O
was O
n't O
like O
a O
man O
; O
it O
was O
like O
some O
damned O
Juggernaut O
. O
I O
gave O
a O
few O
halloa O
, O
took O
to O
my O
heels O
, O
collared O
my O
gentleman O
, O
and O
brought O
him O
back O
to O
where O
there O
was O
already O
quite O
a O
group O
about O
the O
screaming O
child O
. O
He O
was O
perfectly O
cool O
and O
made O
no O
resistance O
, O
but O
gave O
me O
one O
look O
, O
so O
ugly O
that O
it O
brought O
out O
the O
sweat O
on O
me O
like O
running O
. O
The O
people O
who O
had O
turned O
out O
were O
the O
girl O
's O
own O
family O
; O
and O
pretty O
soon O
, O
the O
doctor O
, O
for O
whom O
she O
had O
been O
sent O
put O
in O
his O
appearance O
. O
Well O
, O
the O
child O
was O
not O
much O
the O
worse O
, O
more O
frightened O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Sawbones O
; O
and O
there O
you O
might O
have O
supposed O
would O
be O
an O
end O
to O
it O
. O
But O
there O
was O
one O
curious O
circumstance O
. O
I O
had O
taken O
a O
loathing O
to O
my O
gentleman O
at O
first O
sight O
. O
So O
had O
the O
child O
's O
family O
, O
which O
was O
only O
natural O
. O
But O
the O
doctor O
's O
case O
was O
what O
struck O
me O
. O
He O
was O
the O
usual O
cut O
and O
dry O
apothecary O
, O
of O
no O
particular O
age O
and O
colour O
, O
with O
a O
strong O
Edinburgh O
accent O
and O
about O
as O
emotional O
as O
a O
bagpipe O
. O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O
he O
was O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
; O
every O
time O
he O
looked O
at O
my O
prisoner O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
Sawbones I-PERSON
turn O
sick O
and O
white O
with O
desire O
to O
kill O
him O
. O
I O
knew O
what O
was O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
just O
as O
he O
knew O
what O
was O
in O
mine O
; O
and O
killing O
being O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
we O
did O
the O
next O
best O
. O
We O
told O
the O
man O
we O
could O
and O
would O
make O
such O
a O
scandal O
out O
of O
this O
as O
should O
make O
his O
name O
stink O
from O
one O
end O
of O
London O
to O
the O
other O
. O
If O
he O
had O
any O
friends O
or O
any O
credit O
, O
we O
undertook O
that O
he O
should O
lose O
them O
. O
And O
all O
the O
time O
, O
as O
we O
were O
pitching O
it O
in O
red O
hot O
, O
we O
were O
keeping O
the O
women O
off O
him O
as O
best O
we O
could O
for O
they O
were O
as O
wild O
as O
harpies O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
circle O
of O
such O
hateful O
faces O
; O
and O
there O
was O
the O
man O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
black O
sneering O
coolness O
-- O
frightened O
too O
, O
I O
could O
see O
that O
-- O
but O
carrying O
it O
off O
, O
sir O
, O
really O
like O
Satan O
. O
` O
If O
you O
choose O
to O
make O
capital O
out O
of O
this O
accident O
, O
' O
said O
he O
, O
` O
I O
am O
naturally O
helpless O
. O
No O
gentleman O
but O
wishes O
to O
avoid O
a O
scene O
, O
' O
says O
he O
. O
` O
Name O
your O
figure O
. O
' O
Well O
, O
we O
screwed O
him O
up O
to O
a O
hundred O
pounds O
for O
the O
child O
's O
family O
; O
he O
would O
have O
clearly O
liked O
to O
stick O
out O
; O
but O
there O
was O
something O
about O
the O
lot O
of O
us O
that O
meant O
mischief O
, O
and O
at O
last O
he O
struck O
. O
The O
next O
thing O
was O
to O
get O
the O
money O
; O
and O
where O
do O
you O
think O
he O
carried O
us O
but O
to O
that O
place O
with O
the O
door O
? O
-- O
whipped O
out O
a O
key O
, O
went O
in O
, O
and O
presently O
came O
back O
with O
the O
matter O
of O
ten O
pounds O
in O
gold O
and O
a O
cheque O
for O
the O
balance O
on O
Coutts O
's O
, O
drawn O
payable O
to O
bearer O
and O
signed O
with O
a O
name O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
mention O
, O
though O
it O
's O
one O
of O
the O
points O
of O
my O
story O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
name O
at O
least O
very O
well O
known O
and O
often O
printed O
. O
The O
figure O
was O
stiff O
; O
but O
the O
signature O
was O
good O
for O
more O
than O
that O
if O
it O
was O
only O
genuine O
. O
I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
pointing O
out O
to O
my O
gentleman O
that O
the O
whole O
business O
looked O
apocryphal O
, O
and O
that O
a O
man O
does O
not O
, O
in O
real O
life O
, O
walk O
into O
a O
cellar O
door O
at O
four O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
come O
out O
with O
another O
man O
's O
cheque O
for O
close O
upon O
a O
hundred O
pounds O
. O
But O
he O
was O
quite O
easy O
and O
sneering O
. O
` O
Set O
your O
mind O
at O
rest O
, O
' O
says O
he O
, O
` O
I O
will O
stay O
with O
you O
till O
the O
banks O
open O
and O
cash O
the O
cheque O
myself O
. O
' O
So O
we O
all O
set O
off O
, O
the O
doctor O
, O
and O
the O
child O
's O
father O
, O
and O
our O
friend O
and O
myself O
, O
and O
passed O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
in O
my O
chambers O
; O
and O
next O
day O
, O
when O
we O
had O
breakfasted O
, O
went O
in O
a O
body O
to O
the O
bank O
. O
I O
gave O
in O
the O
cheque O
myself O
, O
and O
said O
I O
had O
every O
reason O
to O
believe O
it O
was O
a O
forgery O
. O
Not O
a O
bit O
of O
it O
. O
The O
cheque O
was O
genuine O
. O
'' O
`` O
Tut-tut O
, O
'' O
said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON
. O
`` O
I O
see O
you O
feel O
as O
I O
do O
, O
'' O
said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Enfield I-PERSON
. O
`` O
Yes O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bad O
story O
. O
For O
my O
man O
was O
a O
fellow O
that O
nobody O
could O
have O
to O
do O
with O
, O
a O
really O
damnable O
man O
; O
and O
the O
person O
that O
drew O
the O
cheque O
is O
the O
very O
pink O
of O
the O
proprieties O
, O
celebrated O
too O
, O
and O
-LRB- O
what O
makes O
it O
worse O

of O
your O
fellows O

honest O

through O
the O

of O

that O

is O
far O
from O
explaining O
all O

'' O
he O
added O
, O
and O
with O
the O
words O
fell O
into O
a O
vein O
of O
musing O
. O
From O
this O
he O
was O
recalled O
by O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON
asking O
rather O
suddenly O
: O
`` O

returned O
Mr. I-PERSON
Enfield I-PERSON

`` O
But O
I O
happen O

some O

`` O
And O
you O
never O
asked O
about O
the O

said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON
. O
`` O
No O
, O
sir O
: O
I O
had O
a O
delicacy O
, O
'' O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
`` O
I O
feel O
very O
strongly O
about O
putting O
questions O
; O
it O
partakes O
too O
much O
of O
the O
style O
of O
the O
day O
of O
judgment O
. O
You O
start O
a O
question O
, O
and O
it O
's O
like O
starting O
a O
stone O
. O
You O
sit O
quietly O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
hill O
; O
and O
away O
the O
stone O
goes O
, O
starting O
others O

presently O
some O
bland O
old O
bird O

the O
last O

would O
have O
thought O

knocked O
on O
the O
head O

his O
own O

to O
change O
their O
name O

No O

I O
make O
it O
a O
rule O
of O
mine O

the O
more O
it O
looks O
like O

the O
less O
I O
ask O

'' O
`` O
A O
very O
good O
rule O

too O

said O
the O
lawyer O

`` O
But O
I O
have O
studied O
the O
place O
for O
myself O

continued O
Mr. I-PERSON
Enfield I-PERSON
. O
`` O
It O
seems O
scarcely O
a O
house O

There O
is O
no O
other O
door O

and O
nobody O
goes O
in O
or O
out O
of O
that O
one O
but O
, O
once O
in O
a O
great O
while O
, O
the O
gentleman O
of O
my O
adventure O

There O
are O
three O
windows O
looking O
on O
the O
court O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
; O
none O
below O
; O
the O
windows O
are O
always O
shut O
but O
they O
're O
clean O
. O
And O
then O
there O
is O
a O
chimney O
which O
is O
generally O
smoking O
; O
so O
somebody O
must O
live O
there O
. O
And O
yet O
it O
's O
not O
so O
sure O
; O
for O
the O
buildings O
are O
so O
packed O
together O
about O
the O
court O
, O
that O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
say O
where O
one O
ends O
and O
another O
begins O
. O
'' O
The O
pair O
walked O
on O
again O
for O
a O
while O
in O
silence O
; O
and O
then O
`` O
Enfield I-PERSON

said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON

`` O
that O

a O
good O

of O
yours O

`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O

returned O
Enfield I-PERSON

`` O
But O
for O
all O
that O
, O
'' O
continued O
the O
lawyer O
, O
`` O
there O
's O
one O
point O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
: O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
the O
name O
of O
that O
man O
who O
walked O
over O
the O
child O

'' O
`` O
Well O
, O
'' O
said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Enfield I-PERSON
, O
`` O
I O
ca O
n't O
see O
what O
harm O
it O
would O
do O

It O
was O
a O
man O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Hyde I-PERSON

'' O
`` O
Hm O

'' O
said O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON

`` O
What O
sort O
of O
a O
man O
is O
he O
to O
see O
? O

`` O
He O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
describe O

There O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
his O
appearance O
; O
something O
displeasing O
, O
something O
down-right O
detestable O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
man O
I O
so O
disliked O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
scarce O
know O
why O
. O
He O
must O
be O
deformed O
somewhere O
; O
he O
gives O
a O
strong O
feeling O
of O
deformity O
, O
although O
I O
could O
n't O
specify O
the O
point O

He O
's O
an O
extraordinary O
looking O
man O

and O
yet O
I O
really O
can O
name O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
way O

No O
, O
sir O
; O
I O
can O
make O
no O
hand O
of O
it O
; O
I O
ca O
n't O
describe O
him O

And O
it O
's O
not O
want O
of O
memory O

for O
I O
declare O
I O
can O
see O
him O
this O
moment O

'' O
Mr. I-PERSON
Utterson I-PERSON
again O
walked O
some O
way O
in O
silence O
and O
obviously O
under O
a O
weight O
of O
consideration O
. O
`` O
You O
are O
sure O
he O
used O
a O
key O
? O
'' O
he O
inquired O
at O
last O
. O
`` O
My O
dear O
sir O

'' O
began O
Enfield I-PERSON
, O
surprised O
out O
of O
himself O
. O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
know O

'' O
said O
Utterson I-PERSON
; O
`` O
I O
know O

must O
seem O
strange O

if O
I O

not O

you O
the O
name O

the O

I O

already O

see O

Richard I-PERSON

your O
tale O
has O
gone O
home O

If O
you O
have O
been O
inexact O
in O
any O

you O
had O
better O
correct O
it O

`` O
I O
think O
you O
might O

me O

returned O
the O

with O
a O
touch O
of O
sullenness O

I O
have O
been O
pedantically O

a O

Mr. I-PERSON

sighed O
deeply O

presently O
