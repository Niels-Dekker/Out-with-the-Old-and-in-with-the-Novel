He O
came O
in O
mid-term O
without O
an O
interview O
, O

May O
it O
was O

no O

would O
have O

from O

of O

' O
A O

, O
' O
Thursgood I-PERSON
told O
the O
common O
room O
, O
' O
a O
temporary O
measure O
, O
' O
and O
brushed O
away O
his O
forelock O
in O
self-defence O

He O
gave O
the O
spelling O

not O

he O
consulted O
the O
slip O
of O

- O
` O
EA O

I O
think O
he O
'll O
do O

very O
well O
till O
July O

' O
The O

had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
reading O
the O

Jim I-PERSON
Prideaux I-PERSON
was O
a O
poor O
white O
of O
the O
teaching O
community O
. O
He O
belonged O
to O
the O
same O
sad O
bunch O
as O
the O
late O
Mrs I-PERSON
Loveday I-PERSON
who O
had O
a O
Persian O
lamb O
coat O
and O
stood O
in O
for O
junior O
divinity O
until O
her O
cheques O
bounced O
, O
or O
the O
late O
Mr I-PERSON
Maltby I-PERSON
, O
the O
pianist O
who O
had O
been O
called O
from O
choir O
practice O
to O
help O
the O
police O
with O
their O
enquiries O
, O
and O
for O
all O
anyone O
knew O
was O
helping O
them O
to O
this O
day O
, O
for O
Maltby O
's O
trunk O
still O
lay O
in O
the O
cellar O
awaiting O
instructions O
. O
Several O
of O
the O
staff O
, O
but O
chiefly O
Marjoribanks I-PERSON
, O
were O
in O
favour O
of O
opening O
that O
trunk O
. O
They O
said O
it O
contained O
notorious O
missing O
treasures O
: O
Aprahamian I-PERSON
's O
silver-framed O
picture O
of O
his O
Lebanese O
mother O
, O
for O
instance O
; O
Best-Ingram I-PERSON
's O
Swiss O
army O
penknife O
and O
Matron I-PERSON
's O
watch O
. O
But O
Thursgood I-PERSON
set O
his O
creaseless O
face O
resolutely O
against O
their O
entreaties O
. O
Only O
five O
years O
had O
passed O
since O
he O
had O
inherited O
the O
school O
from O
his O
father O
, O
but O
they O
had O
taught O
him O
already O
that O
some O
things O
are O
best O
locked O
away O
. O
Jim I-PERSON
Prideaux O
arrived O
on O
a O
Friday O
in O
a O
rainstorm O
. O
The O
rain O
rolled O
like O
gun-smoke O
down O
the O
brown O
combes O
of O
the O
Quantocks O
, O
then O
raced O
across O
the O
empty O
cricket O
fields O
into O
the O
sandstone O
of O
the O
crumbling O
facades O
. O
He O
arrived O
just O
after O
lunch O
, O
driving O
an O
old O
red O
Alvis O
and O
towing O
a O
secondhand O
caravan O
that O
had O
once O
been O
blue O
. O
Early O
afternoons O
at O
Thursgood O
's O
are O
a O
tranquil O
time O
, O
a O
brief O
truce O
in O
the O
running O
fight O
of O
each O
school O
day O
. O
The O
boys O
are O
sent O
to O
rest O
in O
their O
dormitories O
, O
the O
staff O
sit O
in O
the O
common O
room O
over O
coffee O
reading O
newspapers O
or O
correcting O
boys O
' O
work O
. O
Thursgood I-PERSON
reads O
a O
novel O
to O
his O
mother O
. O
Of O
the O
whole O
school O
therefore O
only O
little O
Bill I-PERSON
Roach I-PERSON
actually O
saw O
Jim I-PERSON
arrive O
, O
saw O
the O
steam O
belching O
from O
the O
Alvis O
' O
bonnet O
as O
it O
wheezed O
its O
way O
down O
the O
pitted O
drive O
, O
windscreen O
wipers O
going O
full O
pelt O
and O
the O
caravan O
shuddering O
through O
the O
puddles O
in O
pursuit O
. O
Roach I-PERSON
was O
a O
new O
boy O
in O
those O
days O
and O
graded O
dull O
, O
if O
not O
actually O
deficient O
. O
Thursgood I-PERSON
's O
was O
his O
second O
prep O
school O
in O
two O
terms O
. O
He O
was O
a O
fat O
round O
child O
with O
asthma O
and O
he O
spent O
large O
parts O
of O
his O
rest O
kneeling O
on O
the O
end O
of O
his O
bed O
, O
gazing O
through O
the O
window O
. O
His O
mother O
lived O
grandly O
in O
Bath O
; O
his O
father O
was O
agreed O
to O
be O
the O
richest O
in O
the O
school O
, O
a O
distinction O
which O
cost O
the O
son O
dear O
. O
Coming O
from O
a O
broken O
home O
Roach I-PERSON
was O
also O
a O
natural O
watcher O
. O
In O
Roach I-PERSON
's O
observation O
Jim I-PERSON
did O
not O
stop O
at O
the O
school O
buildings O
but O
continued O
across O
the O
sweep O
to O
the O
stable O
yard O
. O
He O
knew O
the O
layout O
of O
the O
place O
already O
. O
Roach I-PERSON
decided O
later O
that O
he O
must O
have O
made O
a O
reconnaissance O
or O
studied O
maps O
. O
Even O
when O
he O
reached O
the O
yard O
he O
did O
n't O
stop O
but O
drove O
straight O
on O
to O
the O
wet O
grass O
, O
travelling O
at O
speed O
to O
keep O
the O
momentum O
. O
Then O
over O
the O
hummock O
into O
the O
Dip O
, O
head O
first O
and O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Roach I-PERSON
half O
expected O
the O
caravan O
to O
jackknife O
on O
the O
brink O
, O
Jim I-PERSON
took O
it O
over O
so O
fast O
, O
but O
instead O
it O
just O
lifted O
its O
tail O
and O
disappeared O
like O
a O
giant O
rabbit O
into O
its O
hole O
. O
The O
Dip O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
Thursgood O
folklore O
. O
It O
lies O
in O
a O
patch O
of O
waste O
land O
between O
the O
orchard O
, O
the O
fruithouse O
and O
the O
stable O
yard O
. O
To O
look O
at O
, O
it O
is O
no O
more O
than O
a O
depression O
in O
the O
ground O
, O
grass-covered O
, O
with O
hummocks O
on O
the O
northern O
side O
, O
each O
about O
boy-height O
and O
covered O
in O
tufted O
thickets O
which O
in O
summer O
grow O
spongy O
. O
It O
is O
these O
hummocks O
that O
give O
the O
Dip O
its O
special O
virtue O
as O
a O
playground O
and O
also O
its O
reputation O
, O
which O
varies O
with O
the O
fantasy O
of O
each O
new O
generation O
of O
boys O
. O
They O
are O
the O
traces O
of O
an O
open-cast O
silver O
mine O
, O
says O
one O
year O
, O
and O
digs O
enthusiastically O
for O
wealth O
. O
They O
are O
a O
Romano-British O
fort O
, O
says O
another O
, O
and O
stages O
battles O
with O
sticks O
and O
clay O
missiles O
. O
To O
others O
the O
Dip O
is O
a O
bomb-crater O
from O
the O
war O
and O
the O
hummocks O
are O
seated O
bodies O
buried O
in O
the O
blast O
. O
The O
truth O
is O
more O
prosaic O
. O
Six O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
not O
long O
before O
his O
abrupt O
elopement O
with O
a O
receptionist O
from O
the O
Castle O
Hotel O
, O
Thursgood I-PERSON
's O
father O
had O
launched O
an O
appeal O
for O
a O
swimming O
pool O
and O
persuaded O
the O
boys O
to O
dig O
a O
large O
hole O
with O
a O
deep O
and O
a O
shallow O
end O
. O
But O
the O
money O
that O
came O
in O
was O
never O
quite O
enough O
to O
finance O
the O
ambition O
, O
so O
it O
was O
frittered O
away O
on O
other O
schemes O
, O
such O
as O
a O
new O
projector O
for O
the O
art O
school O
, O
and O
a O
plan O
to O
grow O
mushrooms O
in O
the O
school O
cellars O
. O
And O
even O
, O
said O
the O
cruel O
ones O
, O
to O
feather O
a O
nest O
for O
certain O
illicit O
lovers O
when O
they O
eventually O
took O
flight O
to O
Germany O
, O
the O
lady O
's O
native O
home O
. O
Jim I-PERSON
was O
unaware O
of O
these O
associations O
. O
The O
fact O
remains O
that O
by O
sheer O
luck O
he O
had O
chosen O
the O
one O
corner O
of O
Thursgood I-PERSON
's O
academy O
which O
as O
far O
as O
Roach I-PERSON
was O
concerned O
was O
endowed O
with O
supernatural O
properties O
. O
Roach I-PERSON
waited O
at O
the O
window O
but O
saw O
nothing O
more O
. O
Both O
the O
Alvis O
and O
the O
caravan O
were O
in O
dead O
ground O
and O
if O
it O
had O
n't O
been O
for O
the O
wet O
red O
tracks O
across O
the O
grass O
he O
might O
have O
wondered O
whether O
he O
had O
dreamed O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O
But O
the O
tracks O
were O
real O
, O
so O
when O
the O
bell O
went O
for O
the O
end O
of O
rest O
he O
put O
on O
his O
Wellingtons O
and O
trudged O
through O
the O
rain O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Dip O
and O
peered O
down O
and O
there O
was O
Jim I-PERSON
dressed O
in O
an O
army O
raincoat O
and O
a O
quite O
extraordinary O
hat O
, O
broad-brimmed O
like O
a O
safari O
hat O
but O
hairy O
, O
with O
one O
side O
pinned O
up O
in O
a O
rakish O
piratical O
curl O
and O
the O
water O
running O
off O
it O
like O
a O
gutter O
. O
The O
Alvis O
was O
in O
the O
stable O
yard O
; O
Roach I-PERSON
never O
knew O
how O
Jim I-PERSON
spirited O
it O
out O
of O
the O
Dip O
, O
but O
the O
caravan O
was O
right O
down O
there O
, O
at O
what O
should O
have O
been O
the O
deep O
end O
, O
bedded O
on O
platforms O
of O
weathered O
brick O
, O
and O
Jim I-PERSON
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
step O
drinking O
from O
a O
green O
plastic O
beaker O
, O
and O
rubbing O
his O
right O
shoulder O
as O
if O
he O
had O
banged O
it O
on O
something O
, O
while O
the O
rain O
poured O
off O
his O
hat O
. O
Then O
the O
hat O
lifted O
and O
Roach I-PERSON
found O
himself O
staring O
at O
an O
extremely O
fierce O
red O
face O
, O
made O
still O
fiercer O
by O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
brim O
and O
by O
a O
brown O
moustache O
washed O
into O
fangs O
by O
the O
rain O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
face O
was O
criss-crossed O
with O
jagged O
cracks O
, O
so O
deep O
and O
crooked O
that O
Roach I-PERSON
concluded O
in O
another O
of O
his O
flashes O
of O
imaginative O
genius O
that O
Jim I-PERSON
had O
once O
been O
very O
hungry O
in O
a O
tropical O
place O
and O
filled O
up O
again O
since O
. O
The O
left O
arm O
still O
lay O
across O
his O
chest O
, O
the O
right O
shoulder O
was O
still O
drawn O
high O
against O
his O
neck O
. O
But O
the O
whole O
tangled O
shape O
of O
him O
had O
stiffened O
, O
he O
was O
like O
an O
animal O
frozen O
against O
its O
background O
: O
a O
stag O
, O
thought O
Roach I-PERSON
on O
a O
hopeful O
impulse O
, O
something O
noble O
. O
` O
Who O
the O
hell O
are O
you O
? O
' O
asked O
a O
very O
military O
voice O
. O
` O
Sir O
, O
Roach I-PERSON
, O
sir O
. O
I O
'm O
a O
new O
boy O
. O
' O
For O
a O
moment O
longer O
, O
the O
brick O
face O
surveyed O
Roach I-PERSON
from O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
hat O
. O
Then O
, O
to O
his O
intense O
relief O
, O
its O
features O
relaxed O
into O
a O
wolfish O
grin O
, O
the O
left O
hand O
, O
still O
clapped O
over O
the O
right O
shoulder O
, O
resumed O
its O
slow O
massage O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
managed O
a O
long O
pull O
from O
the O
plastic O
beaker O
. O
` O
New O
boy O
, O
eh O
? O
' O
Jim I-PERSON
repeated O
into O
the O
beaker O
, O
still O
grinning O
. O
` O
Well O
that O
's O
a O
turn O
up O
for O
the O
book O
, O
I O
will O
say O
. O
' O
Rising O
now O
, O
and O
turning O
his O
crooked O
back O
on O
Roach I-PERSON
, O
Jim I-PERSON
set O
to O
work O
on O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
detailed O
study O
of O
the O
caravan O
's O
four O
legs O
, O
a O
very O
critical O
study O
which O
involved O
much O
rocking O
of O
the O
suspension O
, O
and O
much O
tilting O
of O
the O
strangely O
garbed O
head O
, O
and O
the O
emplacement O
of O
several O
bricks O
at O
different O
angles O
and O
points O
. O
Meanwhile O
the O
spring O
rain O
was O
clattering O
down O
on O
everything O
: O
his O
coat O
, O
his O
hat O
and O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
old O
caravan O
. O
And O
Roach I-PERSON
noticed O
that O
throughout O
these O
manoeuvres O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
right O
shoulder O
had O
not O
budged O
at O
all O
but O
stayed O
wedged O
high O
against O
his O
neck O
like O
a O
rock O
under O
the O
mackintosh O
. O
Therefore O
he O
wondered O
whether O
Jim I-PERSON
was O
a O
sort O
of O
giant O
hunchback O
and O
whether O
all O
hunch O
backs O
hurt O
as O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
did O
. O
And O
he O
noticed O
as O
a O
generality O
, O
a O
thing O
to O
store O
away O
, O
that O
people O
with O
bad O
backs O
take O
long O
strides O
, O
it O
was O
something O
to O
do O
with O
balance O
. O
` O
New O
boy O
, O
eh O
? O
Well O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
new O
boy O
, O
' O
Jim I-PERSON
went O
on O
, O
in O
altogether O
a O
much O
more O
friendly O
tone O
, O
as O
he O
pulled O
at O
a O
leg O
of O
the O
caravan O
. O
I O
'm O
an O
old O
boy O
. O
Old O
as O
Rip I-PERSON
Van I-PERSON
Winkle I-PERSON
if O
you O
want O
to O
know O
. O
Older O
. O
Got O
any O
friends O
? O
' O
` O
No O
, O
sir O
, O
' O
said O
Roach I-PERSON
simply O
, O
in O
the O
listless O
tone O
which O
schoolboys O
always O
use O
for O
saying O
` O
no O
' O
, O
leaving O
all O
positive O
response O
to O
their O
interrogators O
. O
Jim I-PERSON
however O
made O
no O
response O
at O
all O
, O
so O
that O
Roach I-PERSON
felt O
an O
odd O
stirring O
of O
kinship O
suddenly O
, O
and O
of O
hope O
. O
` O
My O
other O
name O
's O
Bill I-PERSON
, O
' O
he O
said O
. O
' O
I O
was O
christened O
Bill I-PERSON
but O
Mr I-PERSON
Thursgood I-PERSON
calls O
me O
William O
. O
' O
` O
Bill I-PERSON
, O
eh O
. O
The O
unpaid O
Bill I-PERSON
. O
Anyone O
ever O
call O
you O
that O
? O
' O
` O
No O

' O
` O
Good O

. O
' O
` O
Yes O
, O

' O
` O
Known O
a O

of O

. O
They O
've O
all O
been O
good O
` O
uns O
. O
' O
With O
that O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
of O
speaking O
, O
the O
introduction O
was O
made O
. O
Jim I-PERSON
did O
not O
tell O
Roach I-PERSON
to O
go O
away O
so O
Roach I-PERSON
stayed O
on O
the O
brow O
peering O
downward O
through O
his O
rain-smeared O
spectacles O
. O
The O
bricks O
, O
he O
noticed O
with O
awe O
, O
were O
pinched O
from O
the O
cucumber O
frame O
. O
Several O
had O
been O
loose O
already O
and O
Jim I-PERSON
must O
have O
loosened O
them O
a O
bit O
more O
. O
It O
seemed O
a O
wonderful O
thing O
to O
Roach I-PERSON
that O
anyone O
just O
arrived O
at O
Thursgood O
's O
should O
be O
so O
self-possessed O
as O
to O
pinch O
the O
actual O
fabric O
of O
the O
school O
for O
his O
own O
purposes O
, O
and O
doubly O
wonderful O
that O
Jim O
had O
run O
a O
lead O
off O
the O
hydrant O
for O
his O
water O
, O
for O
that O
hydrant O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
special O
school O
rule O
: O
to O
touch O
it O
at O
all O
was O
a O
beatable O
offence O
. O
` O
Hey O
you O
, O
Bill I-PERSON
. O
You O
would O
n't O
have O
such O
a O
thing O

a O
marble O
on O
you O
by O
any O
chance O
? O
' O
` O
A-sir-what-sir O
? O
' O
Roach I-PERSON
asked O
, O
patting O
his O
pockets O
in O
a O
dazed O
way O
. O
` O
Marble O
, O
old O
boy O
. O
Round O
glass O
marble O
, O
little O
ball O
. O
Do O
n't O
boys O
play O
marbles O
any O
more O
? O
We O
did O
when O
I O
was O
at O
school O
. O
' O
Roach I-PERSON
had O
no O
marble O
but O
Aprahamian I-PERSON
had O
had O
a O
whole O
collection O
flown O
in O
from O
Beirut O
. O
It O
took O
Roach I-PERSON
about O
fifty O
seconds O
to O
race O
back O
to O
the O
school O
, O
secure O
one O
against O
the O
wildest O
undertakings O
and O
return O
panting O
to O
the O
Dip O
. O
There O
he O
hesitated O
, O
for O
in O
his O
mind O
the O
Dip O
was O
already O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
and O
Roach I-PERSON
required O
leave O
to O
descend O
it O
. O
But O
Jim I-PERSON
had O
disappeared O
into O
the O
caravan O
, O
so O
having O
waited O
a O
moment O
Roach I-PERSON
stepped O
gingerly O
down O
the O
bank O
and O
offered O
the O
marble O
through O
the O
doorway O
. O
Jim I-PERSON
did O
n't O
spot O
him O
at O
once O
. O
He O
was O
sipping O
from O
the O
beaker O
and O
staring O
out O
of O
the O
window O
at O
the O
black O
clouds O
as O
they O
tore O
this O
way O
and O
that O
over O
the O
Quantocks O
. O
This O
sipping O
movement O
, O
Roach I-PERSON
noticed O
, O
was O
actually O
quite O
difficult O
, O
for O
Jim I-PERSON
could O
not O
easily O
swallow O
standing O
up O
straight O
, O
he O
had O
to O
tilt O
his O
whole O
twisted O
trunk O
backward O
to O
achieve O
the O
angle O
. O
Meanwhile O
the O
rain O
came O
on O
really O
hard O
again O
, O
rattling O
against O
the O
caravan O
like O
gravel O
. O
` O
Sir O
, O
' O
said O
Roach I-PERSON
but O
Jim I-PERSON
made O
no O
move O
. O
` O
Trouble O
with O
an O
Alvis O
is O
, O
no O
damn O
springs O
, O
' O
said O
Jim I-PERSON
at O
last O
, O
more O
to O
the O
window O
than O
to O
his O
visitor O
. O
` O
You O
drive O
along O
with O
your O
rump O
on O
the O
white O
line O
, O
eh O
? O
Cripple O
anybody O
. O
' O
And O
, O
tilting O
his O
trunk O
again O
, O
he O
drank O
. O
` O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
' O
said O
Roach I-PERSON
, O
much O
surprised O
that O
Jim I-PERSON
should O
assume O
he O
was O
a O
driver O
. O
Jim I-PERSON
had O
taken O
off O
his O
hat O
. O
His O
sandy O
hair O
was O
close O
cropped O
, O
there O
were O
patches O
where O
someone O
had O
gone O
too O
low O
with O
the O
scissors O
. O
These O
patches O
were O
mainly O
on O
one O
side O
, O
so O
that O
Roach I-PERSON
guessed O
that O
Jim I-PERSON
had O
cut O
his O
hair O
himself O
with O
his O
good O
arm O
, O
which O
made O
him O
even O
more O
lopsided O
. O
' O
I O
brought O
you O
a O
marble O
, O
' O
said O
Roach I-PERSON
. O
` O
Very O
good O
of O
you O
. O
Thanks O
, O
old O
boy O
. O
' O
Taking O
the O
marble O
he O
slowly O
rolled O
it O
round O
his O
hard O
, O
powdery O
palm O
and O
Roach O
knew O
at O
once O
that O
he O
was O
very O
skilful O
at O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
; O
that O
he O
was O
the O
kind O
of O
man O
who O
lived O
on O
terms O
with O
tools O
and O
objects O
generally O
. O
` O
Not O
level O
, O
you O
see O
, O
Bill O
, O
' O
he O
confided O
, O
still O
intent O
upon O
the O
marble O
. O
` O
Skew-whiff O
. O
Like O
me O
. O
Watch O
, O
' O
and O
turned O
purposefully O
to O
the O
larger O
window O
. O
A O
strip O
of O
aluminium O
beading O
ran O
along O
the O
bottom O
, O
put O
there O
to O
catch O
the O
condensation O
. O
Laying O
the O
marble O
in O
it O
, O
Jim I-PERSON
watched O
it O
roll O
to O
the O
end O
and O
fall O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
` O
Skew-whiff O
, O

repeated O

' O
The O
caravan O
was O
not O
a O
homely O
place O
, O
Roach I-PERSON
noticed O
, O
stooping O
to O
retrieve O
the O
marble O
. O
It O
might O
have O
belonged O
to O
anyone O
, O
though O
it O
was O
scrupulously O
clean O

A O

met O
a O

with O
the O
exception O
of O
Mr I-PERSON

The O
only O
personal O
things O
he O
could O
find O
were O
a O
webbing O
kitbag O
hanging O
from O
the O
door O
, O
a O
set O
of O
sewing O
things O
stored O
beside O
the O

and O
a O
homemade O
shower O
made O
from O
a O
perforated O
biscuit O

and O
neatly O
welded O
to O
the O
roof O
. O
And O
on O
the O
table O
one O
bottle O
of O
colourless O
drink O
, O
gin O
or O
vodka O
, O
because O
that O
was O
what O
his O
father O
drank O
when O
Roach I-PERSON
went O
to O
his O
flat O
for O
weekends O
in O
the O
holidays O
. O
` O
East-west O
looks O
okay O

north-south O
is O
undoubtedly O
skewwhiff O

' O
Jim I-PERSON
declared O
, O
testing O
the O

` O
What O
are O
you O
good O
at O

` O
Are O
you O
a O
swat O
, O
then O
? O
' O
Jim I-PERSON
asked O
carelessly O
, O
as O
he O
lowered O
himself O
with O
a O
short O
grunt O
on O
to O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
took O
a O
pull O
from O
the O
beaker O
. O
` O
You O
do O
n't O
look O

I O
must O
say O
, O
' O
he O
added O
politely O
. O
` O
Although O
you O
're O
a O
loner O
. O
' O
' O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

' O
Roach I-PERSON
repeated O
and O
moved O
half O
a O
pace O
towards O
the O
open O
door O
. O
` O
What O
's O
your O
best O
thing O
, O
then O
? O
' O
He O
took O
another O
long O
sip O
. O
` O
Must O
be O
good O
at O
something O
, O
Bill I-PERSON
, O
everyone O
is O
. O
My O
best O
thing O
was O
ducks O
and O
drakes O
. O
Cheers O
. O
' O
Now O
this O
was O
an O
unfortunate O
question O
to O
ask O
of O
Roach I-PERSON
just O
then O
for O
it O
occupied O
most O
of O
his O
waking O
hours O
. O
Indeed O
he O
had O
recently O
come O
to O
doubt O
whether O
he O
had O
any O
purpose O
on O
earth O
at O
all O
. O
In O
work O
and O
play O
he O
considered O
himself O
seriously O
inadequate O
; O
even O
the O
daily O
routine O
of O
the O
school O
, O
such O
as O
making O
his O
bed O
and O
tidying O
his O
clothes O
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
beyond O
his O
reach O
. O
Also O
he O
lacked O
piety O
, O
old O
Mrs O
Thursgood O
had O
told O
him O
so O
, O
he O
screwed O
up O
his O
face O
too O
much O
at O
chapel O
. O
He O
blamed O
himself O
very O
much O
for O
these O
shortcomings O
but O
most O
of O
all O
he O
blamed O
himself O
for O
the O
break-up O
of O
his O
parents O
' O
marriage O
, O
which O
he O
should O
have O
seen O
coming O
and O
taken O
steps O
to O
prevent O
. O
He O
even O
wondered O
whether O
he O
was O
more O
directly O
responsible O
, O
whether O
for O
instance O
he O
was O
abnormally O
wicked O
or O
divisive O
or O
slothful O
, O
and O
that O
his O
bad O
character O
had O
wrought O
the O
rift O
. O
At O
his O
last O
school O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
explain O
this O
by O
screaming O
and O
feigning O
fits O
of O
cerebral O
palsy O
, O
which O
his O
aunt O
had O
. O
His O
parents O
conferred O
, O
as O
they O
frequently O
did O
in O
their O
reasonable O
way O
, O
and O
changed O
his O
school O
. O
Therefore O
this O
chance O
question O
, O
levelled O
at O
him O
in O
the O
cramped O
caravan O
by O
a O
creature O
at O
least O
half-way O
to O
divinity O
, O
a O
fellow O
solitary O
at O
that O
, O
brought O
him O
suddenly O
very O
near O
disaster O
. O
He O
felt O
the O
heat O
charging O
to O
his O
face O
, O
he O
watched O
his O
spectacles O
mist O
over O
and O
the O
caravan O
begin O
to O
dissolve O
into O
a O
sea O
of O
grief O
. O
Whether O
Jim I-PERSON
noticed O
this O
, O
Roach I-PERSON
never O
knew O
, O
for O
suddenly O
he O
had O
turned O
his O
crooked O
back O
on O
him O
, O
moved O
away O
to O
the O
table O
and O
was O
helping O
himself O
from O
the O
plastic O
beaker O
while O
he O
threw O
out O
saving O
phrases O
. O
` O
You O
're O
a O
good O

, O
anyway O

I O
'll O
tell O
you O

his O

on O

' O
` O
Yes O

Well O

here O

, O
' O
Jim I-PERSON
commanded O
, O
clapping O
the O
safari O
hat O
back O
on O
his O
head O
, O
` O
and O
I O
'll O
slip O
outside O
and O
trim O
the O
legs O

that O

promptly O
and O
stuck O
out O
his O
arm O
at O
random O
. O
` O
Right O
. O
Well O
, O
you O
call O
when O
she O
rolls O
, O
' O
Jim I-PERSON
repeated O
and O
disappeared O
into O
the O
rain O
. O
A O
moment O
later O
Roach I-PERSON
felt O
the O
ground O
swaying O
under O
his O
feet O
and O
heard O
another O
roar O
either O
of O
pain O
or O
anger O
, O
as O
Jim I-PERSON
wrestled O
with O
an O
off-side O
prop O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
that O
same O
summer O
term O
, O
the O
boys O
paid O
Jim I-PERSON
the O
compliment O
of O
a O
nickname O
. O
They O
had O
several O
shots O
before O
they O
were O
happy O
. O
They O
tried O
Trooper O
, O
which O
caught O
the O
bit O
of O
military O
in O
him O
, O
his O
occasional O
, O
quite O
harmless O
cursing O
and O
his O
solitary O
rambles O
in O
the O
Quantocks O
. O
All O
the O
same O
Trooper O
did O
n't O
stick O
, O
so O
they O
tried O
Pirate O
and O
for O
a O
while O
Goulash O
. O
Goulash O
because O
of O
his O
taste O
for O
hot O
food O
, O
the O
smell O
of O
curries O
and O
onions O
and O
paprika O
that O
greeted O
them O
in O
warm O
puffs O
as O
they O
filed O
past O
the O
Dip O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Evensong O
. O
Goulash O
for O
his O
perfect O
French O
which O
was O
held O
to O
have O
a O
slushy O
quality O
. O
Spikely I-PERSON
of O
Five O
B O
could O
imitate O
it O
to O
a O
hair O
: O
` O
You O
heard O
the O
question O
, O
Berger I-PERSON
. O
What O
is O
Emile I-PERSON
looking O
at O
? O
' O
- O
a O
convulsive O
jerk O
of O

' O
But O
these O
terrible O
threats O
were O
never O
carried O
out O
, O
neither O
in O
French O
nor O
English O
. O
In O
a O
quaint O
way O
, O
they O
actually O
added O
to O
the O
aura O
of O
gentleness O
which O
quickly O
surrounded O
him O
, O
a O
gentleness O
only O
possible O
in O
big O
men O
seen O
through O
the O
eyes O
of O
boys O
. O
Yet O
Goulash O
did O
not O
satisfy O
them O
either O
. O
It O
lacked O
the O
hint O
of O
strength O
contained O
. O
It O
took O
no O
account O
of O
Jim I-PERSON

passionate O
Englishness O
, O
which O
was O
the O
only O
subject O
where O
he O
could O
be O
relied O
on O
to O
waste O
time O
. O
Toad O
Spikely I-PERSON

only O
to O
venture O
one O
disparaging O
comment O
on O
the O
monarchy O
, O
extol O
the O
joys O
of O
some O
foreign O
country O
, O
preferably O
a O
hot O
one O

for O
Jim I-PERSON
to O
colour O
sharply O
and O
snap O
out O
a O
good O
three O
minutes O
' O
worth O
on O
the O
privilege O
of O
being O
born O
an O
Englishman O
. O
He O
knew O
they O
were O
teasing O
him O
but O
he O
was O
unable O
not O
to O
rise O
. O
Often O
he O
ended O
his O
homily O
with O
a O
rueful O
grin O
, O
and O
muttered O
references O
to O
red O
herrings O

marks O

when O
certain O
people O
would O

But O

down O

' O
Spikely I-PERSON
did O
not O

Jim I-PERSON
seized O
a O
crayon O

drew O
a O
globe O

To O

play O
on O
Prideaux I-PERSON
, O
partly O
a O
reference O
to O
his O
taste O
for O
living O
off O
the O
land O
and O
his O
appetite O
for O
physical O
exercise O
which O
they O
noted O
constantly O
. O
Shivering O
in O
the O
shower O
queue O
first O
thing O
in O
the O
morning O
they O
would O
see O
the O
Rhino O
pounding O
down O
Combe O
Lane O
with O
a O
rucksack O
on O
his O
crooked O
back O
as O
he O
returned O
from O
his O
morning O
march O
. O
Going O
to O
bed O
they O
could O
glimpse O
his O
lonely O
shadow O
through O
the O
perspex O
roof O
of O
the O
fives O
court O
as O
the O
Rhino O
tirelessly O
attacked O
the O
concrete O
wall O
. O
And O
sometimes O
on O
warm O
evenings O
from O
their O
dormitory O
windows O
they O
would O
covertly O
watch O
him O
at O
golf O
, O
which O
he O
played O
with O
a O
dreadful O
old O
iron O
, O
zigzag O
across O
the O
playing O
fields O
, O
often O
after O
reading O
to O
them O
from O
an O
extremely O
English O
adventure O
book O
: O
Biggles O
, O
Percy O
Westerman O
or O
Jeffrey O
Farnol O
, O
grabbed O
haphazard O
from O
the O
dingy O
library O
. O
At O
each O
stroke O
they O
waited O
for O
the O
grunt O
as O
he O
started O
his O
backswing O
and O
they O
were O
seldom O
disappointed O
. O
They O
kept O
a O
meticulous O
score O
. O
At O
the O
staff O
cricket O
match O
he O
made O
seventy-five O
before O
dismissing O
himself O
with O
a O
ball O
deliberately O
lofted O
to O
Spikely I-PERSON
at O
square O
leg O
. O
` O
Catch O
, O
toad O
, O
catch O
it O
, O
go O
on O
. O
Well O
done O
, O
Spikely I-PERSON
, O
good O
lad O
, O
that O
's O
what O
you O
're O
there O
for O
. O
' O
He O
was O
also O
credited O
, O
despite O
his O
taste O
for O
tolerance O
, O
with O
a O
sound O
understanding O
of O
the O
criminal O
mind O
. O
There O
were O
several O
examples O
of O
this O
, O
but O
the O
most O
telling O
occurred O
a O
few O
days O
before O
the O
end O
of O
term O
, O
when O
Spikely I-PERSON
discovered O
in O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
waste O
basket O
a O
draft O
of O
the O
next O
day O
's O
examination O
paper O
, O
and O
rented O
it O
to O
candidates O
at O
five O
new O
pence O
a O
time O
. O
Several O
boys O
paid O
their O
shilling O
and O
spent O
an O
agonised O
night O
memorising O
answers O
by O
torchlight O
in O
their O
dormitories O
. O
But O
when O
the O
exam O
came O
round O
Jim I-PERSON
presented O
a O
quite O
different O
paper O
. O
` O
You O
can O
look O
at O
this O
one O
for O
nothing O
, O
' O
he O
bellowed O
as O
he O
sat O
down O
. O
And O
having O
hauled O
open O
his O
Daily O
Telegraph O
calmly O
gave O
himself O
over O
to O
the O
latest O
counsels O
of O
the O
juju O
men O
, O
which O
they O
understood O
to O
mean O
almost O
anyone O
with O
intellectual O
pretension O
, O
even O
if O
he O
wrote O
in O
the O
Queen O
's O
cause O
. O
There O
was O
lastly O
the O
incident O
of O
the O
owl O
, O
which O
had O
a O
separate O
place O
in O
their O
opinion O
of O
him O
since O
it O
involved O
death O
, O
a O
phenomenon O
to O
which O
children O
react O
variously O
. O
The O
weather O
continuing O
cold O
, O
Jim I-PERSON
brought O
a O
bucket O
of O
coal O
to O
his O
classroom O
and O
one O
Wednesday O
lit O
it O
in O
the O
grate O
, O
and O
sat O
there O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
warmth O
, O
reading O
a O
dictÃ©e O
. O
First O
some O
soot O
fell O
which O
he O
ignored O
, O
then O
the O
owl O
came O
down O
, O
a O
full-sized O
barn O
owl O
which O
had O
nested O
up O
there O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
through O
many O
unswept O
winters O
and O
summers O
of O
Dover I-PERSON
's O
rule O
, O
and O
was O
now O
smoked O
out O
, O
dazed O
and O
black O
from O
beating O
itself O
to O
exhaustion O
in O
the O
flue O
. O
It O
fell O
over O
the O
coals O
and O
collapsed O
in O
a O
heap O
on O
the O
wooden O
floorboard O
with O
a O
clatter O
and O
a O
scuffle O
, O
then O
lay O
like O
an O
emissary O
of O
the O
devil O
, O
hunched O
but O
breathing O
, O
wings O
stretched O
, O
staring O
straight O
out O
at O
the O
boys O
through O
the O
soot O
which O
caked O
its O
eyes O
. O
There O
was O
no O
one O
who O
was O
not O
frightened O
; O
even O
Spikely I-PERSON
, O
a O
hero O
, O
was O
frightened O
. O
Except O
for O
Jim I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
in O
a O
second O
folded O
the O
beast O
together O
and O
taken O
it O
out O
of O
the O
door O
without O
a O
word O
. O
They O
heard O
nothing O
, O
though O
they O
listened O
like O
stowaways O
, O
till O
the O
sound O
of O
running O
water O
from O
down O
the O
corridor O
as O
Jim I-PERSON
evidently O
washed O
his O
hands O
. O
` O
He O
's O
having O
a O
pee O
, O
' O
said O
Spikely I-PERSON
, O
which O
earned O
a O
nervous O
laugh O
. O
But O
as O
they O
filed O
out O
of O
the O
classroom O
they O
discovered O
the O
owl O
still O
folded O
, O
neatly O
dead O
and O
awaiting O
burial O
on O
top O
of O
the O
compost O
heap O
beside O
the O
Dip O
. O
Its O
neck O
, O
as O
the O
braver O
ones O
established O
, O
was O
snapped O
. O
Only O
a O
gamekeeper O
, O
declared O
Sudeley I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
one O
, O
would O
know O
how O
to O
kill O
an O
owl O
so O
well O
. O
Among O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Thursgood O
community O
, O
opinion O
regarding O
Jim I-PERSON
was O
less O
unanimous O
. O
The O
ghost O
of O
Mr I-PERSON
Maltby I-PERSON
the O
pianist O
died O
hard O
. O
Matron I-PERSON
, O
siding O
with O
Bill I-PERSON
Roach I-PERSON
, O
pronounced O
him O
heroic O
and O
in O
need O
of O
care O
: O
it O
was O
a O
miracle O
he O
managed O
with O
that O
back O
. O
Marjoribanks I-PERSON
said O
he O
had O
been O
run O
over O
by O
a O
bus O
when O
he O
was O
drunk O
. O
It O
was O
Marjoribanks I-PERSON
also O
, O
at O
the O
staff O
match O
where O
Jim I-PERSON
so O
excelled O
, O
who O
pointed O
out O
the O
sweater O
. O
Marjoribanks I-PERSON
was O
not O
a O
cricketer O
but O
he O
had O
strolled O
down O
to O
watch O
with O
Thursgood I-PERSON
. O
` O
Do O
you O
think O
that O
sweater O
's O
kosher O
, O
' O
he O
asked O
in O
a O
high O
, O
jokey O
voice O
, O
` O
or O
do O
you O
think O
he O
pinched O
it O
? O
' O
` O
Leonard I-PERSON
, O
that O
's O
very O
unfair O
, O
' O
Thursgood I-PERSON
scolded O
, O
hammering O
at O
the O
flanks O
of O
his O
Labrador O
. O
` O
Bite O
him O
, O
Ginny I-PERSON
, O
bite O
the O
bad O
man O
. O
' O
By O
the O
time O
he O
reached O
his O
study O
, O
however O
, O
Thursgood O
's O
laughter O
had O
quite O
worn O
off O
and O
he O
became O
extremely O
nervous O
. O
Bogus O
Oxford O
men O
he O
could O
deal O
with O
, O
just O
as O
in O
his O
time O
he O
had O
known O
classics O
masters O
who O
had O
no O
Greek O
and O
parsons O
who O
had O
no O
divinity O
. O
Such O
men O
, O
confronted O
with O
proof O
of O
their O
deception O
, O
broke O
down O
and O
wept O
and O
left O
, O
or O
stayed O
on O
half O
pay O
. O
But O
men O
who O
withheld O
genuine O
accomplishment O
, O
these O
were O
a O
breed O
he O
had O
not O
met O
but O
he O
knew O
already O
that O
he O
did O
not O
like O
them O
. O
Having O
consulted O
the O
university O
calendar O
, O
he O
telephoned O
the O
agency O
, O
a O
Mr O
Stroll O
of O
the O
house O
of O
Stroll O
and O
Medley O
. O
` O
What O
precisely O
do O
you O
want O
to O
know O
? O
' O
Mr I-PERSON
Stroll I-PERSON
asked O
with O
a O
dreadful O
sigh O
. O
` O
Well O
, O
nothing O
precisely O
. O
' O
Thursgood I-PERSON
's O
mother O
was O
sewing O
at O
a O
sampler O
and O
seemed O
not O
to O
hear O
. O
` O
Merely O
that O
if O
one O
asks O
for O
a O
written O
curriculum O
vitae O
one O
likes O
it O
to O
be O
complete O
. O
One O
does O
n't O
like O
gaps O
. O
Not O
if O
one O
pays O
one O
's O
fee O
. O
' O
At O
this O
point O
Thursgood I-PERSON
found O
himself O
wondering O
rather O
wildly O
whether O
he O
had O
woken O
Mr I-PERSON
Stroll I-PERSON
from O
a O
deep O
sleep O
to O
which O
he O
had O
now O
returned O
. O
` O
Very O
patriotic O
bloke O
, O
' O
Mr I-PERSON
Stroll I-PERSON
observed O
finally O
. O
' O
I O
did O
not O
employ O
him O
for O
his O
patriotism O
. O
' O
` O
He O
's O
been O
in O
dock O
, O
' O
Mr O
Stroll O
whispered O
on O
, O
as O
if O
through O
frightful O
draughts O
of O
cigarette O
smoke O
. O
` O
Laid O
up O
. O
Spinal O
. O
' O
` O
Quite O
so O
. O
But O
I O
assume O
he O
has O
not O
been O
in O
hospital O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
last O
twenty-five O
years O
. O
TouchÃ© O
, O
' O
he O
murmured O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
his O
hand O
over O
the O
mouthpiece O
, O
and O
once O
more O
it O
crossed O
his O
mind O
that O
Mr O
Stroll O
had O
dropped O
off O
to O
sleep O
. O
` O
You O
've O
only O
got O
him O
till O
the O
end O
of O
term O
, O
' O
Mr I-PERSON
Stroll I-PERSON
breathed O
. O
` O
If O
you O
do O
n't O
fancy O
him O
, O
chuck O
him O
out O
. O
You O
asked O
for O
temporary O
, O
temporary O
's O
what O
you O
've O
got O
. O
You O
said O
cheap O
, O
you O
've O
got O
cheap O
. O
' O
` O
That O
's O
as O
may O
be O
, O
' O
Thursgood I-PERSON
retorted O
gamely O
. O
` O
But O
I O
've O
paid O
you O
a O
twenty O
guineas O
fee O
, O
my O
father O
dealt O
with O
you O
for O
many O
years O
and O
I O
'm O
entitled O
to O
certain O
assurances O

You O
've O
put O
here O

may O
I O
read O
it O
to O
you O

- O
you O
've O
put O
here O
Before O
his O
injury O
, O
various O
overseas O
appointments O
of O
a O
commercial O
and O
prospecting O
nature O
. O
Now O
that O
is O
hardly O
an O
enlightening O
description O
of O
a O
lifetime O
's O
employment O
, O
is O
it O
? O
' O
At O
her O
sewing O
his O
mother O
nodded O
her O
agreement O
. O
` O
It O
is O
not O
, O
' O
she O
echoed O
aloud O
. O
` O
That O
's O
my O
first O
point O

me O
go O
on O
a O
little O
- O
' O
` O
Not O
too O
much O
, O
darling O
, O
' O
warned O
his O
mother O
. O
' O
I O
happen O
to O
know O
he O
was O
up O
at O
Oxford O
in O
thirty-eight O
. O
Why O
did O

he O
finish O
? O
What O
went O
wrong O
? O
' O
' O
I O
seem O
to O
recall O
there O
was O
an O
interlude O
round O
about O
then O
, O
' O
said O
Mr I-PERSON
Stroll I-PERSON
after O
another O
age O
. O
` O
But O
I O
expect O
you O
're O
too O
young O
to O
remember O
it O

' O
` O
He O
ca O
n't O
have O
been O
in O
prison O
all O
the O
time O
, O
' O
said O
his O
mother O
after O
a O
very O
long O
silence O
, O
still O
without O
looking O
up O
from O
her O
sewing O
. O
` O
He O
's O
been O
somewhere O
, O
' O
said O
Thursgood I-PERSON
morosely O
, O
staring O
across O
the O
windswept O
gardens O
towards O
the O
Dip O
. O
All O
through O
the O
summer O
holidays O
, O
as O
he O
moved O
uncomfortably O
between O
one O
household O
and O
another O
, O
embracing O
and O
rejecting O
, O
Bill I-PERSON
Roach I-PERSON
fretted O
about O
Jim I-PERSON
, O
whether O
his O
back O
was O
hurting O
, O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
for O
money O
now O
that O
he O
had O
no O
one O
to O
teach O
and O
only O
half O
a O
term O
's O
pay O
to O
live O
on O
; O
worst O
of O
all O
whether O
he O
would O
be O
there O
when O
the O
new O
term O
began O
, O
for O
Bill O
had O
a O
feeling O
he O
could O
not O
describe O
that O
Jim I-PERSON
lived O
so O
precariously O
on O
the O
world O
's O
surface O
that O
he O
might O
at O
any O
time O
fall O
off O
into O
a O
void O
; O
for O
he O
feared O
that O
Jim I-PERSON
was O
like O
himself O
, O
without O
a O
natural O
gravity O
to O
hold O
him O
on O
. O
He O
rehearsed O
the O
circumstances O
of O
their O
first O
meeting O
, O
and O
in O
particular O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
enquiry O
regarding O
friendship O
, O
and O
he O
had O
a O
holy O
terror O
that O
just O
as O
he O
had O
failed O
his O
parents O
in O
love O
, O
so O
he O
had O
failed O
Jim I-PERSON
, O
largely O
owing O
to O
the O
disparity O
in O
their O
ages O
. O
And O
that O
therefore O
Jim I-PERSON
had O
moved O
on O
and O
was O
already O
looking O
somewhere O
else O
for O
a O
companion O
, O
scanning O
other O
schools O
with O
his O
pale O
eyes O
. O
He O
imagined O
also O
that O
, O
like O
himself O
, O
Jim I-PERSON
had O
had O
a O
great O
attachment O
that O
had O
failed O
him O
, O
and O
which O
he O
longed O
to O
replace O
. O
But O
here O
Bill I-PERSON
Roach I-PERSON
's O
speculation O
met O
a O
dead O
end O
: O
he O
had O
no O
idea O
how O
adults O
loved O
each O
other O
. O
There O
was O
so O
little O
he O
could O
do O
that O
was O
practical O
. O
He O
consulted O
a O
medical O
book O
and O
interrogated O
his O
mother O
about O
hunchbacks O
and O
he O
longed O
but O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
steal O
a O
bottle O
of O
his O
father O
's O
vodka O
and O
take O
it O
back O
to O
Thursgood O
's O
as O
a O
lure O
. O
And O
when O
at O
last O
his O
mother O
's O
chauffeur O
dropped O
him O
at O
the O
hated O
steps O
, O
he O
did O
not O
pause O
to O
say O
goodbye O
but O
ran O
for O
all O
he O
was O
worth O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Dip O
, O
and O
there O
to O
his O
immeasurable O
joy O
was O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
caravan O
in O
its O
same O
spot O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
a O
shade O
dirtier O
than O
before O
, O
and O
a O
fresh O
patch O
of O
earth O
beside O
it O
, O
he O
supposed O
for O
winter O
vegetables O
. O
And O
Jim I-PERSON
sitting O
on O
the O
step O
grinning O
up O
at O
him O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
heard O
Bill I-PERSON
coming O
and O
got O
the O
grin O
of O
welcome O
ready O
before O
he O
appeared O
at O
the O
brink O
. O
That O
same O
term O
, O
Jim I-PERSON
invented O
a O
nickname O
for O
Roach I-PERSON
. O
He O
dropped O
Bill I-PERSON
and O
called O
him O
Jumbo O
instead O
. O
He O
gave O
no O
reason O
for O
this O
and O
Roach I-PERSON
, O
as O
is O
common O
in O
the O
case O
of O
christenings O
, O
was O
in O
no O
position O
to O
object O
. O
In O
return O
, O
Roach I-PERSON
appointed O
himself O
Jim I-PERSON
's O
guardian O
; O
a O
regent-guardian O
, O
was O
how O
he O
thought O
of O
the O
appointment O
; O
a O
stand-in O
replacing O
Jim I-PERSON

departed O
friend O
, O
whoever O
that O
friend O
might O
be O
