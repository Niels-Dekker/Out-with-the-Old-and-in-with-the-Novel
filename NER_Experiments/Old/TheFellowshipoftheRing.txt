A Long-expected Party When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence , there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton . 
Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar , and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years , ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return . 
The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend , and it was popularly believed , whatever the old folk might say , that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure . 
And if that was not enough for fame , there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at . 
Time wore on , but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins . 
At ninety he was much the same as at fifty . 
At ninety-nine they began to call him we / / - preserved , but unchanged would have been nearer the mark . 
There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing ; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess -LRB- apparently -RRB- perpetual youth as well as -LRB- reputedly -RRB- inexhaustible wealth . 
` It will have to be paid for , ' they said . 
` It is n't natural , and trouble will come of it ! ' 
But so far trouble had not come ; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money , most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune . 
He remained on visiting terms with his relatives -LRB- except , of course , the Sackville-Bagginses -RRB- , and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families . 
But he had no close friends , until some of his younger cousins began to grow up . 
The eldest of these , and Bilbo 's favourite , was young Frodo Baggins . 
When Bilbo was ninety-nine , he adopted Frodo as his heir , and brought him to live at Bag End ; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed . 
Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday , September 22nd . 
` You had better come and live here , Frodo my lad , ' said Bilbo one day ; ` and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together . ' 
At that time Frodo was still in his tweens , as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three . 
Twelve more years passed . 
Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End ; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn . 
Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one , 111 , a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit -LRB- the Old Took himself had only reached 130 -RRB- ; and Frodo was going to be thirty-three , 33 -RRB- an important number : the date of his ` coming of age ' . 
Tongues began to wag in Flobbiton and By water ; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire . 
The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation ; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand . 
No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee , commonly known as the Gaffer . 
He held forth at The Ivy Bush , a small inn on the Bywater road ; and he spoke with some authority , for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years , and had helped old Holman in the same job before that . 
Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints , the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son , Sam Gamgee . 
Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo . 
They lived on the Hill itself , in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End . ' 
A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo , as I 've always said , ' the Gaffer declared . 
With perfect truth : for Bilbo was very polite to him , calling him ` Master Hamfast ' , and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables - in the matter of ` roots ' , especially potatoes , the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood -LRB- including himself -RRB- . 
` But what about this Frodo that lives with him ? ' 
asked Old Noakes of By water . 
` Baggins is his name , but he 's more than half a Brandybuck , they say . 
It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland , where folks are so queer . ' 
` And no wonder they 're queer , ' put in Daddy Twofoot -LRB- the Gaffer 's next-door neighbour -RRB- , ` if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River , and right agin the Old Forest . 
That 's a dark bad place , if half the tales be true . ' 
` You 're right , Dad ! 
` said the Gaffer . 
` Not that the Brandybucks of Buck-land live in the Old Forest ; but they 're a queer breed , seemingly . 
They fool about with boats on that big river - and that is n't natural . 
Small wonder that trouble came of it , I say . 
But be that as it may , Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet . 
Very much like Mr. Bilbo , and in more than looks . 
After all his father was a Baggins . 
A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins ; there was never much to tell of him , till he was drownded . ' 
` Drownded ? ' 
said several voices . 
They had heard this and other darker rumours before , of course ; but hobbits have a passion for family history , and they were ready to hear it again . 
` Well , so they say , ' said the Gaffer . 
` You see : Mr. Drogo , he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck . 
She was our Mr. Bilbo 's first cousin on the mother 's side -LRB- her mother being the youngest of the Old Took 's daughters -RRB- ; and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin . 
So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin , once removed either way , as the saying is , if you follow me . 
And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Flail with his father-in-law , old Master Gorbadoc , as he often did after his marriage -LRB- him being partial to his vittles , and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table -RRB- ; and he went out boating on the Brandywine River ; and he and his wife were drownded , and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all . ' 
` I 've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight , ' said Old Noakes ; ` and it was Drogo 's weight as sunk the boat . ' 
` And / heard she pushed him in , and he pulled her in after him , ' said Sandy man , the Hobbiton miller . 
` You should n't listen to all you hear , Sandyman , ' said the Gaffer , who did not much like the miller . 
` There is n't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling . 
Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble . 
Anyway : there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded , as you might say , among those queer Bucklanders , being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall . 
A regular warren , by all accounts . 
Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place . 
Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk . 
` But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses . 
They thought they were going to get Bag End , that time when he went off and was thought to be dead . 
And then he comes back and orders them off ; and he goes on living and living , and never looking a day older , bless him ! 
And suddenly he produces an heir , and has all the papers made out proper . 
The Sackville-Bagginses wo n't never see the inside of Bag End now , or it is to be hoped not . ' 
` There 's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there , I hear tell , ' said a stranger , a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing . 
` All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver , and jools , by what I 've heard . ' 
` Then you 've heard more than I can speak to , ' answered the Gaffer . 
I know nothing about jools . 
Mr. Bilbo is free with his money , and there seems no lack of it ; but I know of no tunnel-making . 
I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back , a matter of sixty years ago , when I was a lad . 
I 'd not long come prentice to old Holman -LRB- him being my dad 's cousin -RRB- , but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on . 
And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests . 
I do n't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts , where there be mountains of gold , they say ; but there was n't enough to fill tunnels . 
But my lad Sam will know more about that . 
He 's in and out of Bag End . 
Crazy about stories of the old days he is , and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo 's tales . 
Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm , mark you , and I hope no harm will come of it . 
` Elves and Dragons ' Isays to him . 
` Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you . 
Do n't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters , or you 'll land in trouble too big for you , ' I says to him . 
And I might say it to others , ' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller . 
But the Gaffer did not convince his audience . 
The legend of Bilbo 's wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits . 
` Ah , but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first , ' argued the miller , voicing common opinion . 
` He 's often away from home . 
And look at the outlandish folk that visit him : dwarves coming at night , and that old wandering conjuror , Gandalf , and all . 
You can say what you like , Gaffer , but Bag End 's a queer place , and its folk are queerer . ' 
` And you can say what you like , about what you know no more of than you do of boating , Mr. Sandyman , ' retorted the Gaffer , disliking the miller even more than usual . 
If that 's being queer , then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts . 
There 's some not far away that would n't offer a pint of beer to a friend , if they lived in a hole with golden walls . 
But they do things proper at Bag End . 
Our Sam says that everyone 's going to be invited to the party , and there 's going to be presents , mark you , presents for all - this very month as is . ' 
That very month was September , and as fine as you could ask . 
A day or two later a rumour -LRB- probably started by the knowledgeable Sam -RRB- was spread about that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks , what is more , such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century , not indeed since the Old Took died . 
Days passed and The Day drew nearer . 
An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End . 
The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it . 
It was driven by outlandish folk , singing strange songs : dwarves with long beards and deep hoods . 
A few of them remained at Bag End . 
At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight . 
An old man was driving it all alone . 
He wore a tall pointed blue hat , a long grey cloak , and a silver scarf . 
He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat . 
Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill . 
It had a cargo of fireworks , as they rightly guessed . 
At Bilbo 's front door the old man began to unload : there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes , each labelled with a large red G and the elf-rune , . 
That was Gandalf s mark , of course , and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard , whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires , smokes , and lights . 
His real business was far more difficult and dangerous , but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it . 
To them he was just one of the ` attractions ' at the Party . 
Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children . ' 
G for Grand ! 
` they shouted , and the old man smiled . 
They knew him by sight , though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long ; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays - they now belonged to the legendary past . 
When the old man , helped by Bilbo and some dwarves , had finished unloading . 
Bilbo gave a few pennies away ; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming , to the disappointment of the onlookers . 
` Run away now ! 
` said Gandalf . 
` You will get plenty when the time comes . ' 
Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo , and the door was shut . 
The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while , and then made off , feeling that the day of the party would never come . 
Inside Bag End , Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden . 
The late afternoon was bright and peaceful . 
The flowers glowed red and golden : snap-dragons and sun-flowers , and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows . 
` How bright your garden looks ! ' 
said Gandalf . 
` Yes , ' said Bilbo . 
I am very fond indeed of it , and of all the dear old Shire ; but I think I need a holiday . ' 
` You mean to go on with your plan then ? ' ' 
I do . 
I made up my mind months ago , and I have n't changed it . ' 
` Very well . 
It is no good saying any more . 
Stick to your plan - your whole plan , mind - and I hope it will turn out for the best , for you , and for all of us . ' ' 
I hope so . 
Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday , and have my little joke . ' 
` Who will laugh , I wonder ? ' 
said Gandalf , shaking his head . 
` We shall see , ' said Bilbo . 
The next day more carts rolled up the Hill , and still more carts . 
There might have been some grumbling about ` dealing locally ' , but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision , commodity , or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood . 
People became enthusiastic ; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar ; and they watched eagerly for the postman , hoping for invitations . 
Before long the invitations began pouring out , and the Hobbiton post-office was blocked , and the Bywater post-office was snowed under , and voluntary assistant postmen were called for . 
There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill , carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you , I shall certainly come . 
A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End : NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS . 
Even those who had , or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside . 
Bilbo was busy : writing invitations , ticking off answers , packing up presents , and making some private preparations of his own . 
From the time of Gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view . 
One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field , south of Bilbo 's front door , covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions . 
A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road , and wide steps and a large white gate were built there . 
The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row , adjoining the field , were intensely interested and generally envied . 
Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden . 
The tents began to go up . 
There was a specially large pavilion , so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it , and stood proudly near one end , at the head of the chief table . 
Lanterns were hung on all its branches . 
More promising still -LRB- to the hobbits ' mind -RRB- : an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field . 
A draught of cooks , from every inn and eating-house for miles around , arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End . 
Excitement rose to its height . 
Then the weather clouded over . 
That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party . 
Anxiety was intense . 
Then Thursday , September the 22nd , actually dawned . 
The sun got up , the clouds vanished , flags were unfurled and the fun began . 
Bilbo Baggins called it a party , but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one . 
Practically everybody living near was invited . 
A very few were overlooked by accident , but as they turned up all the same , that did not matter . 
Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked ; and there were even a few from outside the borders . 
Bilbo met the guests -LRB- and additions -RRB- at the new white gate in person . 
Ele gave away presents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate . 
Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays . 
Not very expensive ones , as a rule , and not so lavishly as on this occasion ; but it was not a bad system . 
Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody 's birthday , so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week . 
But they never got tired of them . 
On this occasion the presents were unusually good . 
The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating . 
There were toys the like of which they had never seen before , all beautiful and some obviously magical . 
Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before , and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale , and were of real dwarf-make . 
When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate , there were songs , dances , music , games , and , of course , food and drink . 
There were three official meals : lunch , tea , and dinner -LRB- or supper -RRB- . 
But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together . 
At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses until six-thirty , when the fireworks started . 
The fireworks were by Gandalf : they were not only brought by him , but designed and made by him ; and the special effects , set pieces , and flights of rockets were let off by him . 
But there was also a generous distribution of squibs , crackers , backarappers , sparklers , torches , dwarf-candles , elf-fountains , goblin-barkers and thunder-claps . 
They were all superb . 
The art of Gandalf improved with age . 
There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices . 
There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke : their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment , and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits , disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces . 
There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees ; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles , or sailing ships , or a phalanx of flying swans ; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain ; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army , and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes . 
And there was also one last surprise , in honour of Bilbo , and it startled the hobbits exceedingly , as Gandalf intended . 
The lights went out . 
A great smoke went up . 
It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance , and began to glow at the summit . 
It spouted green and scarlet flames . 
Out flew a red-golden dragon - not life-size , but terribly life-like : fire came from his jaws , his eyes glared down ; there was a roar , and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd . 
They all ducked , and many fell flat on their faces . 
The dragon passed like an express train , turned a somersault , and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion . 
That is the signal for supper ! ' 
said Bilbo . 
The pain and alarm vanished at once , and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet . 
There was a splendid supper for everyone ; for everyone , that is , except those invited to the special family dinner-party . 
This was held in the great pavilion with the tree . 
The invitations were limited to twelve dozen -LRB- a number also called by the hobbits one Gross , though the word was not considered proper to use of people -RRB- ; and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related , with the addition of a few special unrelated friends -LRB- such as Gandalf -RRB- . 
Many young hobbits were included , and present by parental permission ; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late , especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal . 
Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender . 
There were many Bagginses and Boffins , and also many Tooks and Brandybucks ; there were various Grubbs -LRB- relations of Bilbo Baggins ' grandmother -RRB- , and various Chubbs -LRB- connexions of his Took grandfather -RRB- ; and selection of Burrowses , Bolgers , Bracegirdles , Brockhouses , Goodbodies , Hornblowers and Proudfoots . 
Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo , and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before , as they lived in remote corners of the Shire . 
The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten . 
Otho and his wife Lobelia were present . 
They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo , but so magnificent was the invitation card , written in golden ink , that they had felt it was impossible to refuse . 
Besides , their cousin , Bilbo , had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation . 
All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast ; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host -LRB- an inevitable item -RRB- . 
Fie was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry ; and sometimes , after a glass or two , would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey . 
The guests were not disappointed : they had a very pleasant feast , in fact an engrossing entertainment : rich , abundant , varied , and prolonged . 
The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks ; but as Bilbo 's catering had depleted the stocks of most stores , cellars and warehouses for miles around , that did not matter much . 
After the feast -LRB- more or less -RRB- came the Speech . 
Most of the company were , however , now in a tolerant mood , at that delightful stage which they called ' filling up the corners ' . 
They were sipping their favourite drinks , and nibbling at their favourite dainties , and their fears were forgotten . 
They were prepared to listen to anything , and to cheer at every full stop . 
My dear People , began Bilbo , rising in his place . ' 
Flear ! 
Flear ! 
Hear ! ' 
they shouted , and kept on repeating it in chorus , seeming reluctant to follow their own advice . 
Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree . 
The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face ; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat . 
They could all see him standing , waving one hand in the air , the other was in his trouser-pocket . 
My dear Bagginses and Boffins , he began again ; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks , and Grubbs , and Chubbs , and Burrowses , and Hornblowers , and Bolgers , Bracegirdles , Goodbodies , Brockhouses and Proudfoots . 
` ProudFEET ! ' 
shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion . 
His name , of course , was Proudfoot , and well merited ; his feet were large , exceptionally furry , and both were on the table . 
Proudfoots , repeated Bilbo . 
Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End . 
Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday : I am eleventy-one today ! ' 
Hurray ! 
Hurray ! 
Many Happy Returns ! ' 
they shouted , and they hammered joyously on the tables . 
Bilbo was doing splendidly . 
This was the sort of stuff they liked : short and obvious . 
I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am . 
Deafening cheers . 
Cries of Yes -LRB- and No -RRB- . 
Noises of trumpets and horns , pipes and flutes , and other musical instruments . 
There were , as has been said , many young hobbits present . 
Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled . 
Most of them bore the mark DALE on them ; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits , but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers . 
They contained instruments , small , but of perfect make and enchanting tones . 
Indeed , in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks , supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished -LRB- since he had plainly said all that was necessary -RRB- , now got up an impromptu orchestra , and began a merry dance-tune . 
Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring : a pretty dance , but rather vigorous . 
But Bilbo had not finished . 
Seizing a horn from a youngster near by , he blew three loud hoots . 
The noise subsided . 
/ shall not keep you long , he cried . 
Cheers from all the assembly . 
/ have called you all together for a Purpose . 
Something in the way that he said this made an impression . 
There was almost silence , and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears . 
Indeed , for Three Purposes ! 
First of all , to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all , and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits . 
Tremendous outburst of approval . 
/ do n't know half of you half as well as I should like ; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve . 
This was unexpected and rather difficult . 
There was some scattered clapping , but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment . 
Secondly , to celebrate my birthday . 
Cheers again . 
I should say : OUR birthday . 
For it is , of course , also the birthday of my heir and nephew , Frodo . 
He comes of age and into his inheritance today . 
Some perfunctory clapping by the elders ; and some loud shouts of ' Frodo ! 
Frodo ! 
Jolly old Frodo , ' from the juniors . 
The Sackville-Bagginses scowled , and wondered what was meant by ` coming into his inheritance ' . 
Together we score one hundred and forty-four . 
Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total : One Gross , if I may use the expression . 
No cheers . 
This was ridiculous . 
Many of his guests , and especially the Sackville-Bagginses , were insulted , feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number , like goods in a package . 
` One Gross , indeed ! 
Vulgar expression . ' 
It is also , if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history , the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake ; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion . 
I was only fifty-one then , and birthdays did not seem so important . 
The banquet was very splendid , however , though I had a bad cold at the time , I remember , and could only say ` thagyou very buch ' . 
I now repeat it more correctly : Thank you very much for coming to my little party . 
Obstinate silence . 
They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent ; and they were getting bored . 
Why could n't he stop talking and let them drink his health ? 
But Bilbo did not sing or recite . 
Fie paused for a moment . 
Thirdly and finally , he said , I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT . 
Fie spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could . 
I regret to announce that - though , as I said , eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you - this is the END . 
I am going . 
I am leaving NOW . 
GOOD-BYE 7 He stepped down and vanished . 
There was a blinding flash of light , and the guests all blinked . 
When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen . 
One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless . 
Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped . 
Then there was a dead silence , until suddenly , after several deep breaths , every Baggins , Boffin , Took , Brandybuck , Grubb , Chubb , Burrows , Bolger , Bracegirdle , Brockhouse , Goodbody , Hornblower , and Proudfoot began to talk at once . 
It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste , and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance . 
` He 's mad . 
I always said so , ' was probably the most popular comment . 
Even the Tooks -LRB- with a few exceptions -RRB- thought Bilbo 's behaviour was absurd . 
For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank . 
But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure . 
Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits , and he said to his daughter-in-law , Esmeralda : ` There 's something fishy in this , my dear ! 
I believe that mad Baggins is off again . 
Silly old fool . 
But why worry ? 
He has n't taken the vittles with him . ' 
He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again . 
Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing . 
For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo 's empty chair , and ignored all remarks and questions . 
He had enjoyed the joke , of course , even though he had been in the know . 
He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests . 
But at the same time he felt deeply troubled : he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly . 
Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins ' oddities , past and present ; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath . 
Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party . 
He gave orders for more wine to be served ; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo , and slipped out of the pavilion . 
As for Bilbo Baggins , even while he was making his speech , he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket : his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years . 
As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger , and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again . 
He walked briskly back to his hole , and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field . 
Then he went in . 
He took off his party clothes , folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat , and put it away . 
Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments , and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt . 
On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard . 
From a locked drawer , smelling of moth-balls , he took out an old cloak and hood . 
They had been locked up as if they were very precious , but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed : it might have been dark green . 
They were rather too large for him . 
He then went into his study , and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths , and a leather-bound manuscript ; and also a large bulky envelope . 
The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there , already nearly full . 
Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring , and its fine chain , and then sealed it , and addressed it to Frodo . 
At first he put it on the mantelpiece , but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket . 
At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in . 
` Hullo ! ' 
said Bilbo . ' 
I wondered if you would turn up . ' ' 
I am glad to find you visible , ' replied the wizard , sitting down in a chair , ' I wanted to catch you and have a few final words . 
I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan ? ' 
` Yes , I do , ' said Bilbo . 
` Though that flash was surprising : it quite startled me , let alone the others . 
A little addition of your own , I suppose ? ' 
It was . 
You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years , and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment . ' 
` And would spoil my joke . 
You are an interfering old busybody , ' laughed Bilbo , ` but I expect you know best , as usual . ' ' 
I do - when I know anything . 
But I do n't feel too sure about this whole affair . 
It has now come to the final point . 
You have had your joke , and alarmed or offended most of your relations , and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days , or ninety-nine more likely . 
Are you going any further ? ' 
` Yes , I am . 
I feel I need a holiday , a very long holiday , as I have told you before . 
Probably a permanent holiday : I do n't expect I shall return . 
In fact , I do n't mean to , and I have made all arrangements . ' 
I am old , Gandalf . 
I do n't look it , but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts . 
Well-preserved indeed ! 
` he snorted . 
` Why , I feel all thin , sort of stretched , if you know what I mean : like butter that has been scraped over too much bread . 
That ca n't be right . 
I need a change , or something . ' 
Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him . 
` No , it does not seem right , ' he said thoughtfully . 
` No , after all I believe your plan is probably the best . ' 
` Well , I 've made up my mind , anyway . 
I want to see mountains again , Gandalf , mountains , and then find somewhere where I can rest . 
In peace and quiet , without a lot of relatives prying around , and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell . 
I might find somewhere where I can finish my book . 
I have thought of a nice ending for it : and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days . ' 
Gandalf laughed . 
I hope he will . 
But nobody will read the book , however it ends . ' 
` Oh , they may , in years to come . 
Frodo has read some already , as far as it has gone . 
You 'll keep an eye on Frodo , wo n't you ? ' 
` Yes , I will - two eyes , as often as I can spare them . ' 
` He would come with me , of course , if I asked him . 
In fact he offered to once , just before the party . 
But he does not really want to , yet . 
I want to see the wild country again before I die , and the Mountains ; but he is still in love with the Shire , with woods and fields and little rivers . 
He ought to be comfortable here . 
I am leaving everything to him , of course , except a few oddments . 
I hope he will be happy , when he gets used to being on his own . 
It 's time he was his own master now . ' 
` Everything ? ' 
said Gandalf . 
` The ring as well ? 
You agreed to that , you remember . ' 
` Well , er , yes , I suppose so , ' stammered Bilbo . 
` Where is it ? ' 
` In an envelope , if you must know , ' said Bilbo impatiently . 
` There on the mantelpiece . 
Well , no ! 
Here it is in my pocket ! ' 
He hesitated . 
` Is n't that odd now ? ' 
he said softly to himself . 
` Yet after all , why not ? 
Why should n't it stay there ? ' 
Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo , and there was a gleam in his eyes . ' 
I think , Bilbo , ' he said quietly , ' I should leave it behind . 
Do n't you want to ? ' 
` Well yes - and no . 
Now it comes to it , I do n't like parting with it at all , I may say . 
And I do n't really see why I should . 
Why do you want me to ? ' 
he asked , and a curious change came over his voice . 
It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance . 
` You are always badgering me about my ring ; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey . ' 
` No , but I had to badger you , ' said Gandalf . ' 
I wanted the truth . 
It was important . 
Magic rings are - well , magical ; and they are rare and curious . 
I was professionally interested in your ring , you may say ; and I still am . 
I should like to know where it is , if you go wandering again . 
Also I think you have had it quite long enough . 
You wo n't need it any more . 
Bilbo , unless I am quite mistaken . ' 
Bilbo flushed , and there was an angry light in his eyes . 
His kindly face grew hard . 
` Why not ? ' 
he cried . 
` And what business is it of yours , anyway , to know what I do with my own things ? 
It is my own . 
I found it . 
It came to me . ' 
` Yes , yes , ' said Gandalf . 
` But there is no need to get angry . ' 
` If I am it is your fault , ' said Bilbo . 
` It is mine , I tell you . 
My own . 
My precious . 
Yes , my precious . ' 
The wizard 's face remained grave and attentive , and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed . 
` It has been called that before , ' he said , ` but not by you . ' 
` But I say it now . 
And why not ? 
Even if Gollum said the same once . 
It 's not his now , but mine . 
And I shall keep it , I say . ' 
Gandalf stood up . 
He spoke sternly . 
` You will be a fool if you do . 
Bilbo , ' he said . 
` You make that clearer with every word you say . 
It has got far too much hold on you . 
Let it go ! 
And then you can go yourself , and be free . ' 
` I 'll do as I choose and go as I please , ' said Bilbo obstinately . 
` Now , now , my dear hobbit ! ' 
said Gandalf . 
` All your long life we have been friends , and you owe me something . 
Come ! 
Do as you promised : give it up ! ' 
` Well , if you want my ring yourself , say so ! ' 
cried Bilbo . 
` But you wo n't get it . 
I wo n't give my precious away , I tell you . ' 
His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword . 
Gandalf s eyes flashed . 
It will be my turn to get angry soon , ' he said . 
If you say that again , I shall . 
Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked . ' 
He took a step towards the hobbit , and he seemed to grow tall and menacing ; his shadow filled the little room . 
Bilbo backed away to the wall , breathing hard , his hand clutching at his pocket . 
They stood for a while facing one another , and the air of the room tingled . 
Gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit . 
Slowly his hands relaxed , and he began to tremble . ' 
I do n't know what has come over you , Gandalf , ` he said . 
` You have never been like this before . 
What is it all about ? 
It is mine is n't it ? 
I found it , and Gollum would have killed me , if I had n't kept it . 
I 'm not a thief , whatever he said . ' ' 
I have never called you one , ' Gandalf answered . 
` And I am not one either . 
I am not trying to rob you , but to help you . 
I wish you would trust me , as you used . ' 
He turned away , and the shadow passed . 
He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man , bent and troubled . 
Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes . 
I am sorry , ' he said . 
` But I felt so queer . 
And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more . 
It has been so growing on my mind lately . 
Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me . 
And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear , do n't you know ; or wondering if it is safe , and pulling it out to make sure . 
I tried locking it up , but I found I could n't rest without it in my pocket . 
I do n't know why . 
And I do n't seem able to make up my mind . ' 
` Then trust mine , ' said Gandalf . 
` It is quite made up . 
Go away and leave it behind . 
Stop possessing it . 
Give it to Frodo , and I will look after him . ' 
Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided . 
Presently he sighed . 
` All right , ' he said with an effort . 
I will . ' 
Then he shrugged his shoulders , and smiled rather ruefully . 
` After all that 's what this party business was all about , really : to give away lots of birthday presents , and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time . 
It has n't made it any easier in the end , but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations . 
It would quite spoil the joke . ' 
` Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair , ' said Gandalf . 
` Very well , ' said Bilbo , ` it goes to Frodo with all the rest . ' 
He drew a deep breath . 
` And now I really must be starting , or somebody else will catch me . 
I have said good-bye , and I could n't bear to do it all over again . ' 
He picked up his bag and moved to the door . 
` You have still got the ring in your pocket , ' said the wizard . 
` Well , so I have ! ' 
cried Bilbo . 
` And my will and all the other documents too . 
You had better take it and deliver it for me . 
That will be safest . ' 
` No , do n't give the ring to me , ' said Gandalf . 
` Put it on the mantelpiece . 
It will be safe enough there , till Frodo comes . 
I shall wait for him . ' 
Bilbo took out the envelope , but just as he was about to set it by the clock , his hand jerked back , and the packet fell on the floor . 
Before he could pick it up , the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place . 
A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit 's face again . 
Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh . 
` Well , that 's that , ' he said . 
` Now I 'm off ! ' 
They went out into the hall . 
Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand ; then he whistled . 
Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy . 
` Is everything ready ? ' 
asked Bilbo . 
` Everything packed and labelled ? ' 
` Everything , ' they answered . 
` Well , let 's start then ! ' 
He stepped out of the front-door . 
It was a fine night , and the black sky was dotted with stars . 
He looked up , sniffing the air . 
` What fun ! 
What fun to be off again , off on the Road with dwarves ! 
This is what I have really been longing for , for years ! 
Good-bye ! ' 
he said , looking at his old home and bowing to the door . 
` Good-bye , Gandalf ! ' 
` Good-bye , for the present , Bilbo . 
Take care of yourself ! 
You are old enough , and perhaps wise enough . ' 
` Take care ! 
I do n't care . 
Do n't you worry about me ! 
I am as happy now as I have ever been , and that is saying a great deal . 
But the time has come . 
I am being swept off my feet at last , ' he added , and then in a low voice , as if to himself , he sang softly in the dark : The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began . 
Now far ahead the Road has gone , And I must follow , if I can , Pursuing it with eager feet , Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet . 
And whither then ? 
I can not say . 
He paused , silent for a moment . 
Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents , and followed by his three companions went round into his garden , and trotted down the long sloping path . 
He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom , and took to the meadows , passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass . 
Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness . ' 
Goodbye , my dear Bilbo - until our next meeting ! ' 
he said softly and went back indoors . 
Frodo came in soon afterwards , and found him sitting in the dark , deep in thought . 
` Has he gone ? ' 
he asked . 
` Yes , ' answered Gandalf , ` he has gone at last . ' ' 
I wish -1 mean , I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke , ' said Frodo . 
` But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go . 
He always used to joke about serious things . 
I wish I had come back sooner , just to see him off . ' 
I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end , ' said Gandalf . 
` Do n't be too troubled . 
He 'll be all right - now . 
He left a packet for you . 
There it is ! ' 
Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece , and glanced at it , but did not open it . 
` You 'll find his will and all the other documents in there , I think , ' said the wizard . 
` You are the master of Bag End now . 
And also , I fancy , you 'll find a golden ring . ' 
` The ring ! ' 
exclaimed Frodo . 
` Has he left me that ? 
I wonder why . 
Still , it may be useful . ' 
` It may , and it may not , ' said Gandalf . ' 
I should not make use of it , if I were you . 
But keep it secret , and keep it safe ! 
Now I am going to bed . ' 
As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests . 
Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field , but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning . 
About midnight carriages came for the important folk . 
One by one they rolled away , filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits . 
Gardeners came by arrangement , and removed in wheel-barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind . 
Night slowly passed . 
The sun rose . 
The hobbits rose rather later . 
Morning went on . 
People came and began -LRB- by orders -RRB- to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs , and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates , and the lanterns , and the flowering shrubs in boxes , and the crumbs and cracker-paper , the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs , and the uneaten food -LRB- a very small item -RRB- . 
Then a number of other people came -LRB- without orders -RRB- : Bagginses , and Boffins , and Bolgers , and Tooks , and other guests that lived or were staying near . 
By mid-day , when even the best-fed were out and about again , there was a large crowd at Bag End , uninvited but not unexpected . 
Frodo was waiting on the step , smiling , but looking rather tired and worried . 
He welcomed all the callers , but he had not much more to say than before . 
His reply to all inquiries was simply this : ` Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away ; as far as I know , for good . ' 
Some of the visitors he invited to come inside , as Bilbo had left ` messages ' for them . 
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture . 
On every item there was a label tied . 
There were several labels of this sort : For ADELARD TOOK , for his VERY OWN , from Bilbo , on an umbrella . 
Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones . 
For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence , with love from Bilbo , on a large waste-paper basket . 
Dora was Drogo 's sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo ; she was ninety-nine , and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century . 
For MILO BURROWS , hoping it will be useful , from B.B. , on a gold pen and ink-bottle . 
Milo never answered letters . 
For ANGELICA 'S use , from Uncle Bilbo , on a round convex mirror . 
She was a young Baggins , and too obviously considered her face shapely . 
For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE , from a contributor , on an -LRB- empty -RRB- book-case . 
Hugo was a great borrower of books , and worse than usual at returning them . 
For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS , as a PRESENT , on a case of silver spoons . 
Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons , while he was away on his former journey . 
Fobelia knew that quite well . 
When she arrived later in the day , she took the point at once , but she also took the spoons . 
This is only a small selection of the assembled presents . 
Bilbo 's residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life . 
It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up : for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible . 
Not , of course , that the birthday-presents were always new , there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district ; but Bilbo had usually given new presents , and kept those that he received . 
The old hole was now being cleared a little . 
Every one of the various parting gifts had labels , written out personally by Bilbo , and several had some point , or some joke . 
But , of course , most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome . 
The poorer hobbits , and especially those of Bagshot Row , did very well . 
Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes , a new spade , a woollen waistcoat , and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints . 
Old Rory Brandybuck , in return for much hospitality , got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards : a strong red wine from the Southfarthing , and now quite mature , as it had been laid down by Bilbo 's father . 
Rory quite forgave Bilbo , and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle . 
There was plenty of everything left for Frodo . 
And , of course , all the chief treasures , as well as the books , pictures , and more than enough furniture , were left in his possession . 
There was , however , no sign nor mention of money or jewellery : not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away . 
Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon . 
A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire ; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there , but could not be kept out . 
Fabels got torn off and mixed , and quarrels broke out . 
Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall ; and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them , or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched . 
The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts . 
In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived . 
Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things . 
When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo , Merry bowed politely . 
` He is indisposed , ' he said . 
` He is resting . ' 
` Hiding , you mean , ' said Fobelia . 
` Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him . 
Just go and tell him so ! ' 
Merry left them a long while in the hall , and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons . 
It did not improve their tempers . 
Eventually they were shown into the study . 
Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him . 
He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate ; and he stood up , fidgeting with something in his pocket . 
But he spoke quite politely . 
The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive . 
They began by offering him bad bargain-prices -LRB- as between friends -RRB- for various valuable and unlabelled things . 
When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away , they said the whole affair was very fishy . 
` Only one thing is clear to me , ' said Otho , ` and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it . 
I insist on seeing the will . ' 
Otho would have been Bilbo 's heir , but for the adoption of Frodo . 
He read the will carefully and snorted . 
It was , unfortunately , very clear and correct -LRB- according to the legal customs of hobbits , which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink -RRB- . 
` Foiled again ! ' 
he said to his wife . 
` And after waiting sixty years . 
Spoons ? 
Fiddlesticks ! ' 
He snapped his fingers under Frodo 's nose and slumped off . 
But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of . 
A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place , investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors . 
He escorted her firmly off the premises , after he had relieved her of several small -LRB- but rather valuable -RRB- articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella . 
Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark ; but all she found to say , turning round on the step , was : ` You 'll live to regret it , young fellow ! 
Why did n't you go too ? 
You do n't belong here ; you 're no Baggins - you - you 're a Brandybuck ! ' 
` Did you hear that , Merry ? 
That was an insult , if you like , ' said Frodo as he shut the door on her . 
` It was a compliment , ' said Merry Brandybuck , ` and so , of course , not true . ' 
Then they went round the hole , and evicted three young hobbits -LRB- two Boffins and a Bolger -RRB- who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars . 
Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot -LRB- old Odo Proudfoot 's grandson -RRB- , who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry , where he thought there was an echo . 
The legend of Bilbo 's gold excited both curiosity and hope ; for legendary gold -LRB- mysteriously obtained , if not positively ill-gotten -RRB- , is , as every one knows , any one 's for the finding - unless the search is interrupted . 
When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out , Frodo collapsed on chair in the hall . 
It 's time to close the shop , Merry , ' he said . 
` Lock the door , and do n't open it to anyone today , not even if they bring a battering ram . ' 
Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea . 
He had hardly sat down , when there came a soft knock at the front-door . 
` Lobelia again most likely , ' he thought . 
` She must have thought of something really nasty , and have come back again to say it . 
It can wait . ' 
He went on with his tea . 
The knock was repeated , much louder , but he took no notice . 
Suddenly the wizard 's head appeared at the window . 
` If you do n't let me in , Frodo , I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill , ' he said . 
` My dear Gandalf ! 
Half a minute ! ' 
cried Frodo , running out of the room to the door . 
` Come in ! 
Come in ! 
I thought it was Lobelia . ' 
` Then I forgive you . 
But I saw her some time ago , driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk . ' 
` She had already nearly curdled me . 
Honestly , I nearly tried on Bilbo 's ring . 
I longed to disappear . ' 
` Do n't do that ! ' 
said Gandalf , sitting down . 
` Do be careful of that ring , Frodo ! 
In fact , it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word . ' 
` Well , what about it ? ' 
` What do you know already ? ' 
` Only what Bilbo told me . 
I have heard his story : how he found it , and how he used it : on his journey , I mean . ' 
` Which story , I wonder , ' said Gandalf . 
` Oh , not what he told the dwarves and put in his book , ' said Frodo . 
` He told me the true story soon after I came to live here . 
He said you had pestered him till he told you , so I had better know too . 
` No secrets between us , Frodo , ' he said ; ` but they are not to go any further . 
It 's mine anyway . '' 
` That 's interesting , ' said Gandalf . 
` Well , what did you think of it all ? ' 
` If you mean , inventing all that about a ` present ' , well , I thought the true story much more likely , and I could n't see the point of altering it at all . 
It was very unlike Bilbo to do so , anyway ; and I thought it rather odd . ' 
` So did I . 
But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures - if they use them . 
Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it . 
It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to . ' ' 
I do n't understand , ' said Frodo . 
` Neither do I , ' answered the wizard . ' 
I have merely begun to wonder about the ring , especially since last night . 
No need to worry . 
But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom , or not at all . 
At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion . 
I say again : keep it safe , and keep it secret ! ' 
` You are very mysterious ! 
What are you afraid of ? ' ' 
I am not certain , so I will say no more . 
I may be able to tell you something when I come back . 
I am going off at once : so this is good-bye for the present . ' 
He got up . 
` At once ! 
` cried Frodo . 
` Why , I thought you were staying on for at least a week . 
I was looking forward to your help . ' ' 
I did mean to - but I have had to change my mind . 
I may be away for a good while ; but I 'll come and see you again , as soon as I can . 
Expect me when you see me ! 
I shall slip in quietly . 
I sha n't often be visiting the Shire openly again . 
I find that I have become rather unpopular . 
They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace . 
Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away , or worse . 
If you want to know , there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth . ' 
` Some people ! ' 
exclaimed Frodo . 
` You mean Otho and Lobelia . 
How abominable ! 
I would give them Bag End and everything else , if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him . 
I love the Shire . 
But I begin to wish , somehow , that I had gone too . 
I wonder if I shall ever see him again . ' 
` So do I , ' said Gandalf . 
` And I wonder many other things . 
Good-bye now ! 
Take care of yourself ! 
Lookout for me , especially at unlikely times ! 
Good-bye ! ' 
Frodo saw him to the door . 
He gave a final wave of his hand , and walked off at a surprising pace ; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent , almost as if he was carrying a great weight . 
The evening was closing in , and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight . 
Frodo did not see him again for a long time .
