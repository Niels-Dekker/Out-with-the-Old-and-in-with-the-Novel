0.037403090572618	253	|I have seldom seen such brawn in a man . |	|His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy . |	|His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner , and from his fine stature , I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia . |	1	DEFAULT

0.960982463791629	391	|look at that tomahawk ! |	|But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen . |	|Going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ' old Congo baby . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.87490516763891	383	|In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him . |	|Meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms . |	|As I live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years ' War , and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt . |	1	DEFAULT

0.498289191863539	190	|In fact , the artist 's design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject . |	|The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane ; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads . |	|The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . |	0

0.607714811720797	50	|Why did the poor poet of Tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach ? |	|Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ? |	|Why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ? |	0

0.953670313890998	112	|As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing . |	|For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me . |	|Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her , yet Nantucket was her great original -- the Tyre of this Carthage ; -- the place where the first dead American whale was stranded . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.807791262351648	64	|It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not . |	|And as for going as cook , -- though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board -- yet , somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls ; -- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will . |	|It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids . |	1	DEFAULT

0.547346575538656	87	|how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition ! |	|Finally , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck . |	|For as in this world , head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern -LRB- that is , if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim -RRB- , so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle . |	1	DEFAULT
