Although O

no O
more O

than O

yet O

as O
it O

so O
in O

that O

Now O
, O
Miss O
Amelia PER
Sedley PER
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
this O
singular O
species O
; O
and O
deserved O
not O
only O
all O
that O
Miss O

in O
her O

but O
had O
many O
charming O
qualities O
which O
that O
pompous O
old O
Minerva LOC

not O
see O

from O
the O
differences O

rank O

she O
could O
not O

a O

and O
embroider O
beautifully O

she O
had O
such O
a O
kindly O

smiling O

tender O

gentle O

generous O
heart O

Miss MISC

on O
the O
day O

away O

such O

Miss O

attachment O

as O

supposed O
from O
the O
high O
position O

eminent O
virtues O
of O
that O
lady O
, O
calm O
and O
dignified O
; O
but O
Miss O
Jemima PER
had O
already O
whimpered O
several O
times O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Amelia PER
's O
departure O
; O
and O
, O
but O
for O
fear O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
would O
have O
gone O
off O
in O
downright O
hysterics O
, O
like O
the O
heiress O
( O
who O
paid O
double O
) O
of O
St. LOC
Kitt LOC

. O
Such O
luxury O
of O
grief O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O
allowed O
to O
parlour-boarders O
. O
Honest O
Jemima PER
had O
all O
the O
bills O
, O

the O
washing O

and O
the O
mending O
, O
and O
the O
puddings O
, O
and O
the O
plate O
and O
crockery O
, O
and O
the O
servants O
to O
superintend O
. O
But O
why O
speak O
about O
her O
? O
It O
is O
probable O
that O
we O
shall O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
again O
from O
this O
moment O
to O
the O
end O
of O
time O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
great O
filigree O
iron O
gates O
are O
once O
closed O
on O
her O
, O
she O
and O
her O
awful O
sister O
will O
never O
issue O
therefrom O
into O
this O
little O
world O
of O
history O
. O
But O
as O
we O
are O
to O
see O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Amelia PER
, O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
saying O
, O
at O
the O
outset O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a O
dear O
little O
creature O
; O
and O
a O
great O
mercy O
it O
is O
, O
both O
in O
life O
and O
in O
novels O
, O
which O
( O
and O
the O
latter O
especially O
) O
abound O
in O
villains O
of O
the O
most O
sombre O
sort O
, O
that O
we O
are O
to O
have O
for O
a O
constant O
companion O
so O
guileless O
and O
good-natured O
a O
person O
. O
As O
she O
is O
not O
a O
heroine O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
describe O
her O
person O
; O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
her O
nose O
was O
rather O
short O
than O
otherwise O
, O
and O
her O
cheeks O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
round O
and O
red O
for O
a O
heroine O
; O
but O
her O
face O
blushed O
with O
rosy O
health O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
with O
the O
freshest O
of O
smiles O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
which O
sparkled O
with O
the O
brightest O
and O
honestest O
good-humour O
, O
except O
indeed O
when O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
that O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
often O
; O
for O
the O
silly O
thing O
would O
cry O
over O
a O
dead O
canary-bird O
; O
or O
over O
a O
mouse O
, O
that O
the O
cat O
haply O
had O
seized O
upon O
; O
or O
over O
the O
end O
of O
a O
novel O
, O
were O
it O
ever O
so O
stupid O
; O
and O
as O
for O
saying O
an O
unkind O
word O
to O
her O
, O
were O
any O
persons O
hard-hearted O
enough O
to O
do O
so O
-- O
why O
, O
so O
much O
the O
worse O
for O
them O
. O
Even O
Miss O
Pinkerton PER
, O
that O
austere O
and O
godlike O
woman O
, O
ceased O
scolding O
her O
after O
the O
first O
time O
, O
and O
though O
she O
no O
more O
comprehended O
sensibility O
than O
she O
did O
Algebra PER
, O
gave O
all O
masters O
and O
teachers O
particular O
orders O
to O
treat O
Miss O
Sedley PER
with O
the O
utmost O
gentleness O
, O
as O
harsh O
treatment O
was O
injurious O
to O
her O

So O
that O
when O
the O
day O
of O
departure O
came O
, O
between O
her O
two O
customs O
of O
laughing O
and O
crying O
, O
Miss O

greatly O
puzzled O
how O
to O

All O

this O

we O
may O
be O
pretty O

that O

entirely O
the O

a O

that O

Miss O

partiality O

his O

the O
next O
morning O

with O
a O

The O

curious O
it O

that O

It O
was O
in O

a O

Rebecca PER

Mrs. O

the O
idea O

even O

of O
such O

that O
