0.72345262046609	275	|` I beg your pardon , ' said Alice very humbly : ` you had got to the fifth bend , I think ? ' |	|` I had NOT ! ' |	|cried the Mouse , sharply and very angrily . |	1	Mouse									
0.955597684994317	127	|However , the Multiplication Table does n't signify : let 's try Geography . |	|London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome -- no , THAT 'S all wrong , I 'm certain ! |	|I must have been changed for Mabel ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.367403399772485	94	|And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it . |	|` They must go by the carrier , ' she thought ; ` and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one 's own feet ! |	|And how odd the directions will look ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.238828178341934	172	|` Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' |	|cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings . |	|` I quite forgot you did n't like cats . ' |	1	Alice									
0.853373931444408	39	|I wish you were down here with me ! |	|There are no mice in the air , I 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know . |	|But do cats eat bats , I wonder ? ' |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.945278745636054	174	|` I quite forgot you did n't like cats . ' |	|` Not like cats ! ' |	|cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice . |	0										
0.083936216476864	154	|However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . |	|` I wish I had n't cried so much ! ' |	|said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . |	1	Alice									
0.528079646779918	69	|First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; ` for it might end , you know , ' said Alice to herself , ` in my going out altogether , like a candle . |	|I wonder what I should be like then ? ' |	|And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing . |	1	Alice									
0.304951505091682	179	|And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . |	|She is such a dear quiet thing , ' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ` and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she 's such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon ! ' |	|cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended . |	3	Dinah	Alice	Mouse							
0.71223998432551	195	|cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ` I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! ' |	|For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went . |	|So she called softly after it , ` Mouse dear ! |	2	Alice	Mouse								
0.900678969799007	57	|Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . |	|How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ` and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor Alice , ` it would be of very little use without my shoulders . |	|Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! |	1	Alice									
0.578790043239526	203	|A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank -- the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable . |	|The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life . |	|Indeed , she had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , ` I am older than you , and must know better ' ; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was , and , as the Lory positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to be said . |	1	Alice									
0.63149089438306	87	|cried Alice -LRB- she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English -RRB- ; ` now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! |	|Good-bye , feet ! ' |	|-LRB- for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off -RRB- . |	0										
0.30884577696123	136	|I shall only look up and say `` Who am I then ? |	|Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else '' -- but , oh dear ! ' |	|cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ` I do wish they WOULD put their heads down ! |	1	Alice									
0.57867790600688	67	|said Alice ; ` I must be shutting up like a telescope . ' |	|And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden . |	|First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; ` for it might end , you know , ' said Alice to herself , ` in my going out altogether , like a candle . |	1	Alice									
0.65697338618638	181	|cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended . |	|` We wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . ' |	|` We indeed ! ' |	2	DEFAULT	Mouse								
0.873759084997558	192	|A little bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair ! |	|And it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I ca n't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds ! |	|He says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear ! ' |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.370017969003042	308	|It 's high time you were all in bed ! ' |	|On various pretexts they all moved off , and Alice was soon left alone . |	|` I wish I had n't mentioned Dinah ! ' |	1	Alice									
0.130501933537623	43	|Do cats eat bats ? ' |	|and sometimes , ` Do bats eat cats ? ' |	|for , you see , as she could n't answer either question , it did n't much matter which way she put it . |	0										
0.583624921894446	221	|` I thought you did , ' said the Mouse . |	|` -- I proceed . |	|`` Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable -- ``' ` Found WHAT ? ' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.454685313339386	47	|when suddenly , thump ! |	|thump ! |	|down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over . |	0										
0.466514607056262	111	|Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ` If you please , sir -- ' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go . |	|Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : ` Dear , dear ! |	|How queer everything is to-day ! |	1	Alice									
0.774000195584802	74	|` Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! ' |	|said Alice to herself , rather sharply ; ` I advise you to leave off this minute ! ' |	|She generally gave herself very good advice , -LRB- though she very seldom followed it -RRB- , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people . |	1	Alice									
0.905628645476901	292	|Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper ! ' |	|` Hold your tongue , Ma ! ' |	|said the young Crab , a little snappishly . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.786529225297144	201	|Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore . |	|CHAPTER III . |	|A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank -- the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable . |	0										
0.454264295964405	218	|said the Mouse , frowning , but very politely : ` Did you speak ? ' |	|` Not I ! ' |	|said the Lory hastily . |	1	Lory									
0.265617792425408	198	|Do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' |	|When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale -LRB- with passion , Alice thought -RRB- , and it said in a low trembling voice , ` Let us get to the shore , and then I 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . ' |	|It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures . |	2	Mouse	Alice								
0.00801870674443	149	|And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! ' |	|As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! |	|she was up to her chin in salt water . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.13966013574247	153	|-LRB- Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . -RRB- |	|However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . |	|` I wish I had n't cried so much ! ' |	1	Alice									
0.125060241170128	220	|said the Lory hastily . |	|` I thought you did , ' said the Mouse . |	|` -- I proceed . |	2	Mouse	Lory								
0.645009625066577	22	|Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think -- ' -LRB- for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over -RRB- ` -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ? ' |	|-LRB- Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . -RRB- |	|Presently she began again . |	1	Alice									
0.04326601132743	226	|` I know what `` it '' means well enough , when I find a thing , ' said the Duck : ` it 's generally a frog or a worm . |	|The question is , what did the archbishop find ? ' |	|The Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , ``` -- found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown . |	0										
0.347430666811559	10	|First , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . |	|She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ` ORANGE MARMALADE ' , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it . |	|` Well ! ' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.893893090923643	161	|` Would it be of any use , now , ' thought Alice , ` to speak to this mouse ? |	|Everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . ' |	|So she began : ` O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? |	1	Alice									
0.266511918620733	107	|It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ` Oh ! |	|the Duchess , the Duchess ! |	|Oh ! |	0										
0.949033581879532	115	|I wonder if I 've been changed in the night ? |	|Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? |	|I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . |	1										
0.024577160404502	132	|` I 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ` I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh ! |	|ever so many lessons to learn ! |	|No , I 've made up my mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here ! |	0										
0.128882860265952	243	|There was no ` One , two , three , and away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over . |	|However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ` The race is over ! ' |	|and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , ` But who has won ? ' |	1	Dodo									
0.53623916058206	282	|` You insult me by talking such nonsense ! ' |	|` I did n't mean it ! ' |	|pleaded poor Alice . |	1	Alice									
0.938516754390831	29	|-LRB- and she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you 're falling through the air ! |	|Do you think you could manage it ? -RRB- |	|` And what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.284021248597226	137	|Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else '' -- but , oh dear ! ' |	|cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ` I do wish they WOULD put their heads down ! |	|I am so VERY tired of being all alone here ! ' |	1	Alice									
0.596688298824028	119	|Ah , THAT 'S the great puzzle ! ' |	|And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them . |	|` I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , ' she said , ` for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n't be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.260143930213145	78	|Why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person ! ' |	|Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ` EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants . |	|` Well , I 'll eat it , ' said Alice , ` and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I 'll get into the garden , and I do n't care which happens ! ' |	1	Alice									
0.195008319066973	250	|` Why , SHE , of course , ' said the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , ` Prizes ! |	|Prizes ! ' |	|Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , -LRB- luckily the salt water had not got into it -RRB- , and handed them round as prizes . |	0										
0.584773665591749	91	|I 'm sure _ I _ sha n't be able ! |	|I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; -- but I must be kind to them , ' thought Alice , ` or perhaps they wo n't walk the way I want to go ! |	|Let me see : I 'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas . ' |	1	Alice									
0.607913645464876	268	|And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this : -- ` Fury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , `` Let us both go to law : I will prosecute YOU . |	|-- Come , I 'll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning I 've nothing to do . '' |	|Said the mouse to the cur , `` Such a trial , dear Sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath . '' |	1	Mouse									
0.244622880916269	187	|Do n't let me hear the name again ! ' |	|` I wo n't indeed ! ' |	|said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation . |	1	Alice									
0.022335548921002	13	|thought Alice to herself , ` after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs ! |	|How brave they 'll all think me at home ! |	|Why , I would n't say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house ! ' |	1	Alice									
0.868135667210215	32	|No , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere . ' |	|Down , down , down . |	|There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again . |	0										
0.45986506587921	182	|` We wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . ' |	|` We indeed ! ' |	|cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail . |	0										
0.275662646739819	38	|Dinah my dear ! |	|I wish you were down here with me ! |	|There are no mice in the air , I 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know . |	2	Dinah	DEFAULT								
0.5154471933228	302	|And she 's such a capital one for catching mice you ca n't think ! |	|And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds ! |	|Why , she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! ' |	3	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
0.980681138813761	8	|The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well . |	|Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next . |	|First , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . |	1	Alice									
0.781519325497047	163	|So she began : ` O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? |	|I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! ' |	|-LRB- Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother 's Latin Grammar , ` A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse ! ' -RRB- |	2	Alice	Mouse								
0.685295033887545	21	|` I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . |	|Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think -- ' -LRB- for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over -RRB- ` -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ?

0.893711746251719	242	|First it marked out a race-course , in a sort of circle , -LSB- ` the exact shape does n't matter , ' it said , -RRB- and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there . |	|There was no ` One , two , three , and away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over . |	|However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ` The race is over ! ' |	0										
0.483715989036176	245	|and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , ` But who has won ? ' |	|This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead -LRB- the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him -RRB- , while the rest waited in silence . |	|At last the Dodo said , ` EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes . ' |	1	Dodo									
0.293683600333413	49	|down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over . |	|Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . |	|There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ` Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' |	2	Alice	White Rabbit								
0.64510212724235	72	|After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! |	|when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried . |	|` Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! ' |	1	Alice									
0.852479208809602	314	|I wonder if I shall ever see you any more ! ' |	|And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited . |	|In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story . |	1	Alice									
0.617034098951625	306	|Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking , ` I really must be getting home ; the night-air does n't suit my throat ! ' |	|and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , ` Come away , my dears ! |	|It 's high time you were all in bed ! ' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.884887386740834	252	|Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , -LRB- luckily the salt water had not got into it -RRB- , and handed them round as prizes . |	|There was exactly one a-piece all round . |	|` But she must have a prize herself , you know , ' said the Mouse . |	0										
0.953233560923948	271	|`` I 'll be judge , I 'll be jury , '' Said cunning old Fury : `` I 'll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death . |	|''' ` You are not attending ! ' |	|said the Mouse to Alice severely . |	1	Alice									
0.728870523418483	20	|she said aloud . |	|` I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . |	|Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think -- ' -LRB- for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over -RRB- ` -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ?

0.97252681052969	177	|` Would YOU like cats if you were me ? ' |	|` Well , perhaps not , ' said Alice in a soothing tone : ` do n't be angry about it . |	|And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . |	1	Alice

0.312580679807006	58	|How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ` and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor Alice , ` it would be of very little use without my shoulders . |	|Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! |	|I think I could , if I only knew how to begin .

0.630411971590917	299	|` And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ? ' |	|said the Lory . |	|Alice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet : ` Dinah 's our cat . |	1	Lory

0.785564494894087	294	|said the young Crab , a little snappishly . |	|` You 're enough to try the patience of an oyster ! ' |	|` I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do ! ' |	1	DEFAULT

0.983807961188924	188	|` I wo n't indeed ! ' |	|said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation . |	|` Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ? ' |	1	Alice									
0.774711944196029	246	|This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead -LRB- the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him -RRB- , while the rest waited in silence . |	|At last the Dodo said , ` EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes .

0.206566375105111	118	|But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ? |	|Ah , THAT 'S the great puzzle ! ' |	|And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them . |	0										
0.152685034046749	60	|I think I could , if I only knew how to begin .

0.557509391481423	170	|which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book . |	|The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . |	|` Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' |	1	Mouse									
0.25226355718903	9	|Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next . |	|First , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . |	|She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ` ORANGE MARMALADE ' , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.332874769242708	46	|She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ` Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? ' |	|when suddenly , thump ! |	|thump ! |	0										
0.317617634118735	240	|` Why , ' said the Dodo , ` the best way to explain it is to do it .

0.120956017878736	71	|And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing . |	|After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! |	|when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.485821697644899	156	|said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . |	|` I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! |	|That WILL be a queer thing , to be sure ! |	1	Alice									
0.431181178254178	236	|And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds tittered audibly . |	|` What I was going to say , ' said the Dodo in an offended tone , ` was , that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race .

0.070176798816813	52	|She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . |	|There were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again . |	|Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! |	1	Alice

0.762668450638338	144	|She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether . |	|` That WAS a narrow escape !

0.0414486020783	56	|However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted ! |	|Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . |	|How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ` and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor Alice , ` it would be of very little use without my shoulders . |	1	Alice
