0.672029374221002	91	|The second was written to Mr. Booker , of the ` Literary Chronicle . ' |	|Mr. Booker was a hard-working professor of literature , by no means without talent , by no means without influence , and by no means without a conscience . |	|But , from the nature of the struggles in which he had been engaged , by compromises which had gradually been driven upon him by the encroachment of brother authors on the one side and by the demands on the other of employers who looked only to their profits , he had fallen into a routine of work in which it was very difficult to be scrupulous , and almost impossible to maintain the delicacies of a literary conscience . |	1	Mr. Booker									
0.124460312322526	292	|He was very dark , with that soft olive complexion which so generally gives to young men an appearance of aristocratic breeding . |	|His hair , which was never allowed to become long , was nearly black , and was soft and silky without that taint of grease which is so common with silken-headed darlings . |	|His eyes were long , brown in colour , and were made beautiful by the perfect arch of the perfect eyebrow . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.774945547479062	11	|I almost think you will like my ` Criminal Queens . ' |	|The sketch of Semiramis is at any rate spirited , though I had to twist it about a little to bring her in guilty . |	|Cleopatra , of course , I have taken from Shakespeare . |	2	DEFAULT	Semiramis								
0.608861589641564	230	|She had hitherto endeavoured to do her duty , knowing that in accepting her position she was bound to take the good and the bad together . |	|She had certainly encountered hitherto much that was bad . |	|To be scolded , watched , beaten , and sworn at by a choleric old man till she was at last driven out of her house by the violence of his ill-usage ; to be taken back as a favour with the assurance that her name would for the remainder of her life be unjustly tarnished ; to have her flight constantly thrown in her face ; and then at last to become for a year or two the nurse of a dying debauchee , was a high price to pay for such good things as she had hitherto enjoyed . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.393228726177405	182	|CHAPTER II . |	|THE CARBURY FAMILY . |	|Something of herself and condition Lady Carbury has told the reader in the letters given in the former chapter , but more must be added . |	0										
0.639723491255049	264	|She was almost proud of his vices , and had taken delight in hearing of doings which if not vicious of themselves had been ruinous from their extravagance . |	|She had so indulged him that even in her own presence he was never ashamed of his own selfishness or apparently conscious of the injustice which he did to others . |	|From all this it had come to pass that that dabbling in literature which had been commenced partly perhaps from a sense of pleasure in the work , partly as a passport into society , had been converted into hard work by which money if possible might be earned . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.486606256492846	260	|The mother 's feeling was less noble , -- or perhaps , it might better be said , more open to censure . |	|The boy , who had been beautiful as a star , had ever been the cynosure of her eyes , the one thing on which her heart had rivetted itself . |	|Even during the career of his folly she had hardly ventured to say a word to him with the purport of stopping him on his road to ruin . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.257088955385429	248	|Sir Felix was then twenty-five , had been in a fashionable regiment for four years , had already sold out , and , to own the truth at once , had altogether wasted the property which his father had left him . |	|So much the mother knew , -- and knew , therefore , that with her limited income she must maintain not only herself and daughter , but also the baronet . |	|She did not know , however , the amount of the baronet 's obligations ; -- nor , indeed , did he , or any one else . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.028898966690792	141	|But censure from those who are always finding fault is regarded so much as a matter of course that it ceases to be objectionable . |	|The caricaturist , who draws only caricatures , is held to be justifiable , let him take what liberties he may with a man 's face and person . |	|It is his trade , and his business calls upon him to vilify all that he touches . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.787584906729553	157	|He also was intimate after his fashion with Lady Carbury , whose diligence in making and fostering useful friendships had been unwearied . |	|Her letter to Mr. Alf was as follows ; -- DEAR MR. ALF , -- Do tell me who wrote the review on Fitzgerald Barker 's last poem . |	|Only I know you wo n't . |	3	Lady Carbury	Mr. Ferdinand Alf	Fitzgerald Barker							
0.529377261705511	23	|I am afraid that I have been tempted into too great length about the Italian Catherine ; but in truth she has been my favourite . |	|What a woman ! |	|What a devil ! |	0										
0.031354894677161	14	|What a wench she was ! |	|I could not quite make Julia a queen ; but it was impossible to pass over so piquant a character . |	|You will recognise in the two or three ladies of the empire how faithfully I have studied my Gibbon . |	2	DEFAULT	Julia								
0.700822609977735	118	|Stretched-out type , insufficient lines , and the French habit of meandering with a few words over an entire page , had been rebuked by him with conscientious strength . |	|He was supposed to be rather an Aristides among reviewers . |	|But circumstanced as he was he could not oppose himself altogether to the usages of the time . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.014325299040076	301	|But he had been clever enough to dress himself always with simplicity and to avoid the appearance of thought about his outward man . |	|As yet the little world of his associates had hardly found out how callous were his affections , -- or rather how devoid he was of affection . |	|His airs and his appearance , joined with some cleverness , had carried him through even the viciousness of his life . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.713992506814351	167	|To puff and to get one 's self puffed have become different branches of a new profession . |	|Alas , me ! |	|I wish I might find a class open in which lessons could be taken by such a poor tyro as myself . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.525218779558693	66	|Is it not so ? |	|Surely you do not wish to put an end to the friendship between us ! ' |	|` Put an end to our friendship , Lady Carbury ! |	1	Lady Carbury									
0.569348284948791	247	|At the time of the writing of the three letters , at which our story is supposed to begin , she was driven very hard for money . |	|Sir Felix was then twenty-five , had been in a fashionable regiment for four years , had already sold out , and , to own the truth at once , had altogether wasted the property which his father had left him . |	|So much the mother knew , -- and knew , therefore , that with her limited income she must maintain not only herself and daughter , but also the baronet . |	1	Felix Carbury									
0.698784108994836	318	|Now there was another young lady , to whom the reader shall be introduced in time , whom Sir Felix was instigated to pursue with unremitting diligence . |	|Her wealth was not defined , as had been the # 40,000 of her predecessor , but was known to be very much greater than that . |	|It was , indeed , generally supposed to be fathomless , bottomless , endless . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.82866403047728	181	|She therefore seized her pen and began scribbling further notes . |	|CHAPTER II . |	|THE CARBURY FAMILY . |	0										
0.503771728439959	265	|She had so indulged him that even in her own presence he was never ashamed of his own selfishness or apparently conscious of the injustice which he did to others . |	|From all this it had come to pass that that dabbling in literature which had been commenced partly perhaps from a sense of pleasure in the work , partly as a passport into society , had been converted into hard work by which money if possible might be earned . |	|So that Lady Carbury when she wrote to her friends , the editors , of her struggles was speaking the truth . |	0										
0.595614906099276	92	|Mr. Booker was a hard-working professor of literature , by no means without talent , by no means without influence , and by no means without a conscience . |	|But , from the nature of the struggles in which he had been engaged , by compromises which had gradually been driven upon him by the encroachment of brother authors on the one side and by the demands on the other of employers who looked only to their profits , he had fallen into a routine of work in which it was very difficult to be scrupulous , and almost impossible to maintain the delicacies of a literary conscience . |	|He was now a bald-headed old man of sixty , with a large family of daughters , one of whom was a widow dependent on him with two little children . |	1	Mr. Booker									
0.983787449620941	281	|The woman was false from head to foot , but there was much of good in her , false though she was . |	|Whether Sir Felix , her son , had become what he was solely by bad training , or whether he had been born bad , who shall say ? |	|It is hardly possible that he should not have been better had he been taken away as an infant and subjected to moral training by moral teachers . |	2	Felix Carbury	DEFAULT								
0.650505664915237	94	|He was now a bald-headed old man of sixty , with a large family of daughters , one of whom was a widow dependent on him with two little children . |	|He had five hundred a year for editing the ` Literary Chronicle , ' which , through his energy , had become a valuable property . |	|He wrote for magazines , and brought out some book of his own almost annually . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.101727227442072	160	|I remember nothing done so well . |	|I should think the poor wretch will hardly hold his head up again before the autumn . |	|But it was fully deserved . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.814568662980564	309	|But he lacked something in the art of making love . |	|He was beautiful , had the manners of a gentleman , could talk well , lacked nothing of audacity , and had no feeling of repugnance at declaring a passion which he did not feel . |	|But he knew so little of the passion , that he could hardly make even a young girl believe that he felt it . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.755423283356028	242	|She wanted no luxury but a house so placed that people might conceive of her that she lived in a proper part of the town . |	|Of her daughter 's prudence she was as well convinced as of her own . |	|She could trust Henrietta in everything . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.686660137071615	127	|Then there was letter No. 3 , to Mr. Ferdinand Alf . |	|Mr. Alf managed , and , as it was supposed , chiefly owned , the ` Evening Pulpit , ' which during the last two years had become ` quite a property , ' as men connected with the press were in the habit of saying . |	|The ` Evening Pulpit ' was supposed to give daily to its readers all that had been said and done up to two o'clock in the day by all the leading people in the metropolis , and to prophesy with wonderful accuracy what would be the sayings and doings of the twelve following hours . |	1	Mr. Ferdinand Alf									
0.891990130054534	97	|He kept his head above water , and was regarded by those who knew about him , but did not know him , as a successful man . |	|He always kept up his spirits , and was able in literary circles to show that he could hold his own . |	|But he was driven by the stress of circumstances to take such good things as came in his way , and could hardly afford to be independent . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.949072229778957	54	|It may be as well to give a short record of a scene which had taken place between Lady Carbury and her friend about a month before the writing of this letter which has been produced . |	|She had wanted him to take a series of papers for the ` Morning Breakfast Table , ' and to have them paid for at rate No. 1 , whereas she suspected that he was rather doubtful as to their merit , and knew that , without special favour , she could not hope for remuneration above rate No. 2 , or possibly even No. 3 . |	|So she had looked into his eyes , and had left her soft , plump hand for a moment in his . |	1	Lady Carbury									
0.230943703543483	29	|Guilty ! |	|guilty always ! |	|Adultery , murder , treason , and all the rest of it . |	0										
0.087029733231172	333	|At the present time she was barely twenty-one years old , and had not seen much of London society . |	|Her mother did not frequent balls , and during the last two years there had grown upon them a necessity for economy which was inimical to many gloves and costly dresses . |	|Sir Felix went out of course , but Hetta Carbury spent most of her time at home with her mother in Welbeck Street . |	1	Hetta Carbury									
0.904106745884842	40	|Or rather , as you are a friend , be loving . |	|Yours gratefully and faithfully , MATILDA CARBURY . |	|After all how few women there are who can raise themselves above the quagmire of what we call love , and make themselves anything but playthings for men . |	1	Matilda Carbury									
0.352429446357666	293	|His hair , which was never allowed to become long , was nearly black , and was soft and silky without that taint of grease which is so common with silken-headed darlings . |	|His eyes were long , brown in colour , and were made beautiful by the perfect arch of the perfect eyebrow . |	|But perhaps the glory of the face was due more to the finished moulding and fine symmetry of the nose and mouth than to his other features . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.846382997725441	56	|So she had looked into his eyes , and had left her soft , plump hand for a moment in his . |	|A man in such circumstances is so often awkward , not knowing with any accuracy when to do one thing and when another ! |	|Mr. Broune , in a moment of enthusiasm , had put his arm round Lady Carbury 's waist and had kissed her . |	0										
0.299475421378864	35	|It would be uninteresting ; -- perhaps untrue . |	|I have accused her lovingly , and have kissed when I scourged . |	|I trust the British public will not be angry because I do not whitewash Caroline , especially as I go along with them altogether in abusing her husband . |	2	DEFAULT	Caroline								
0.581628458722737	273	|Who had more of that audacity which is the chief thing necessary to the winning of heiresses ? |	|And then he could make his wife Lady Carbury . |	|If only enough money might be earned to tide over the present evil day , all might be well . |	2	DEFAULT	Lady Carbury								
0.255346219156114	136	|The ` Evening Pulpit ' was much given to politics , but held strictly to the motto which it had assumed ; -- ` Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri ; ' -- and consequently had at all times the invaluable privilege of abusing what was being done , whether by one side or by the other . |	|A newspaper that wishes to make its fortune should never waste its columns and weary its readers by praising anything . |	|Eulogy is invariably dull , -- a fact that Mr. Alf had discovered and had utilized . |	0										
0.112174981249373	63	|No unpardonable insult had been offered ; no harm had been done , if only the dear susceptible old donkey could be made at once to understand that that was n't the way to go on ! |	|Without a flutter , and without a blush , she escaped from his arm , and then made him an excellent little speech . |	|` Mr. Broune , how foolish , how wrong , how mistaken ! |	2	DEFAULT	Mr. Broune								
0.771202351685546	191	|She was true to her children , -- especially devoted to one of them , -- and was ready to work her nails off if by doing so she could advance their interests . |	|She was the widow of one Sir Patrick Carbury , who many years since had done great things as a soldier in India , and had been thereupon created a baronet . |	|He had married a young wife late in life and , having found out when too late that he had made a mistake , had occasionally spoilt his darling and occasionally ill used her . |	2	DEFAULT	Patrick								
0.441476289705397	268	|Tidings had reached her of this and the other man 's success , and , -- coming near to her still , -- of this and that other woman 's earnings in literature . |	|And it had seemed to her that , within moderate limits , she might give a wide field to her hopes . |	|Why should she not add a thousand a year to her income , so that Felix might again live like a gentleman and marry that heiress who , in Lady Carbury 's look-out into the future , was destined to make all things straight ! |	1	Lady Carbury									
0.96325895785306	52	|But the end of all was to induce some one to do something which would cause a publisher to give her good payment for indifferent writing , or an editor to be lenient when , upon the merits of the case , he should have been severe . |	|Among all her literary friends , Mr. Broune was the one in whom she most trusted ; and Mr. Broune was fond of handsome women . |	|It may be as well to give a short record of a scene which had taken place between Lady Carbury and her friend about a month before the writing of this letter which has been produced . |	2	Lady Carbury	Mr. Broune								
0.140428173888281	32	|But recommended to mercy because she was royal . |	|A queen bred , born and married , and with such other queens around her , how could she have escaped to be guilty ? |	|Marie Antoinette I have not quite acquitted . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.142464728376574	332	|She , at any rate , had not been spoilt by a title , by the command of money , and by the temptations of too early acquaintance with the world . |	|At the present time she was barely twenty-one years old , and had not seen much of London society . |	|Her mother did not frequent balls , and during the last two years there had grown upon them a necessity for economy which was inimical to many gloves and costly dresses . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.429546976627226	130	|This was effected with an air of wonderful omniscience , and not unfrequently with an ignorance hardly surpassed by its arrogance . |	|But the writing was clever . |	|The facts , if not true , were well invented ; the arguments , if not logical , were seductive . |	0										
0.582120756290127	305	|There had been a quarrel between him and a brother officer , in which he had been the aggressor ; and , when the moment came in which a man 's heart should have produced manly conduct , he had first threatened and had then shown the white feather . |	|That was now a year since , and he had partly outlived the evil ; -- but some men still remembered that Felix Carbury had been cowed , and had cowered . |	|It was now his business to marry an heiress . |	1	Felix Carbury									
0.775375954577242	84	|The lady who uses a street cab must encounter mud and dust which her richer neighbour , who has a private carriage , will escape . |	|She would have preferred not to have been kissed ; -- but what did it matter ? |	|With Mr. Broune the affair was more serious . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.704707914837549	68	|` Put an end to our friendship , Lady Carbury ! |	|Oh , certainly not that . ' |	|` Then why risk it by such an act ? |	0										
0.011380509798813	240	|Accident at first rather than choice had thrown her among literary people , but that accident had , during the last two years , been supported and corroborated by the desire which had fallen upon her of earning money . |	|She had known from the first that economy would be necessary to her , -- not chiefly or perhaps not at all from a feeling that she and her daughter could not live comfortably together on a thousand a year , -- but on behalf of her son . |	|She wanted no luxury but a house so placed that people might conceive of her that she lived in a proper part of the town . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.157547181889817	236	|Nor would she marry again for convenience . |	|But she would have friends , -- real friends ; friends who could help her , -- and whom possibly she might help . |	|She would , too , make some career for herself , so that life might not be without an interest to her . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.431398357340161	170	|Much as I hate the thing from my very soul , and much as I admire the consistency with which the ` Pulpit ' has opposed it , I myself am so much in want of support for my own little efforts , and am struggling so hard honestly to make for myself a remunerative career , that I think , were the opportunity offered to me , I should pocket my honour , lay aside the high feeling which tells me that praise should be bought neither by money nor friendship , and descend among the low things , in order that I might one day have the pride of feeling that I had succeeded by my own work in providing for the needs of my children . |	|But I have not as yet commenced the descent downwards ; and therefore I am still bold enough to tell you that I shall look , not with concern but with a deep interest , to anything which may appear in the ` Pulpit ' respecting my ` Criminal Queens . ' |	|I venture to think that the book , -- though I wrote it myself , -- has an importance of its own which will secure for it some notice . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.76689342342128	5	|Lady Carbury was rapid in everything , and in nothing more rapid than in the writing of letters . |	|Here is Letter No. 1 ; -- Thursday , Welbeck Street . |	|DEAR FRIEND , -- I have taken care that you shall have the early sheets of my two new volumes to-morrow , or Saturday at latest , so that you may , if so minded , give a poor struggler like myself a lift in your next week 's paper . |	0										
0.304026998602147	317	|And so that young lady escaped the pit-fall . |	|Now there was another young lady , to whom the reader shall be introduced in time , whom Sir Felix was instigated to pursue with unremitting diligence . |	|Her wealth was not defined , as had been the # 40,000 of her predecessor , but was known to be very much greater than that . |	1	Felix Carbury									
0.248357353221641	151	|He had been black-balled at three or four clubs , but had effected an entrance at two or three others , and had learned a manner of speaking of those which had rejected him calculated to leave on the minds of hearers a conviction that the societies in question were antiquated , imbecile , and moribund . |	|He was never weary of implying that not to know Mr. Alf , not to be on good terms with Mr. Alf , not to understand that let Mr. Alf have been born where he might and how he might he was always to be recognised as a desirable acquaintance , was to be altogether out in the dark . |	|And that which he so constantly asserted , or implied , men and women around him began at last to believe , -- and Mr. Alf became an acknowledged something in the different worlds of politics , letters , and fashion . |	2	DEFAULT	Mr. Ferdinand Alf								
0.680290606526515	155	|He dressed with the utmost simplicity , but also with the utmost care . |	|He was unmarried , had a small house of his own close to Berkeley Square at which he gave remarkable dinner parties , kept four or five hunters in Northamptonshire , and was reputed to earn # 6,000 a year out of the ` Evening Pulpit ' and to spend about half of that income . |	|He also was intimate after his fashion with Lady Carbury , whose diligence in making and fostering useful friendships had been unwearied . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.690580032575531	44	|I have striven so hard to be proper ; but when girls read everything , why should not an old woman write anything ? |	|This letter was addressed to Nicholas Broune , Esq. , the editor of the ` Morning Breakfast Table , ' a daily newspaper of high character ; and , as it was the longest , so was it considered to be the most important of the three . |	|Mr. Broune was a man powerful in his profession , -- and he was fond of ladies . |	1	Mr. Broune									
0.130276201624345	201	|He had his attractive qualities . |	|He was a man who might be loved ; -- but he was hardly a man for love . |	|The young Lady Carbury had understood her position and had determined to do her duty . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.477804505639384	255	|Henrietta had been taught by the conduct of both father and mother that every vice might be forgiven in a man and in a son , though every virtue was expected from a woman , and especially from a daughter . |	|The lesson had come to her so early in life that she had learned it without the feeling of any grievance . |	|She lamented her brother 's evil conduct as it affected him , but she pardoned it altogether as it affected herself . |	1	Henrietta Carbury									
0.16119527158218	193	|He had married a young wife late in life and , having found out when too late that he had made a mistake , had occasionally spoilt his darling and occasionally ill used her . |	|In doing each he had done it abundantly . |	|Among Lady Carbury 's faults had never been that of even incipient , -- not even of sentimental infidelity to her husband . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.48287608824662	76	|When a man has kissed a woman it goes against the grain with him to say the very next moment that he is sorry for what he has done . |	|It is as much as to declare that the kiss had not answered his expectation . |	|Mr. Broune could not do this , and perhaps Lady Carbury did not quite expect it . |	1	Mr. Broune									
0.408663630567733	149	|Nevertheless it was conceded to him that he knew England as only an Englishman can know it . |	|During the last year or two he had ` come up ' as the phrase goes , and had come up very thoroughly . |	|He had been black-balled at three or four clubs , but had effected an entrance at two or three others , and had learned a manner of speaking of those which had rejected him calculated to leave on the minds of hearers a conviction that the societies in question were antiquated , imbecile , and moribund . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.568323464850135	215	|In latter years he drank too much , and she struggled hard first to prevent the evil , and then to prevent and to hide the ill effects of the evil . |	|But in doing all this she schemed , and lied , and lived a life of manoeuvres . |	|Then , at last , when she felt that she was no longer quite a young woman , she allowed herself to attempt to form friendships for herself , and among her friends was one of the other sex . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.269770716099668	31	|Adultery , murder , treason , and all the rest of it . |	|But recommended to mercy because she was royal . |	|A queen bred , born and married , and with such other queens around her , how could she have escaped to be guilty ? |	1	DEFAULT									
0.692267493869528	221	|Her life at that period is of little moment to our story , except that it is essential that the reader should know in what she had been slandered . |	|For a month or two all hard words had been said against her by her husband 's friends , and even by Sir Patrick himself . |	|But gradually the truth was known , and after a year 's separation they came again together and she remained the mistress of his house till he died . |	2	DEFAULT	Patrick								
0.529385084503474	263	|In everything she had spoilt him as a boy , and in everything she still spoilt him as a man . |	|She was almost proud of his vices , and had taken delight in hearing of doings which if not vicious of themselves had been ruinous from their extravagance . |	|She had so indulged him that even in her own presence he was never ashamed of his own selfishness or apparently conscious of the injustice which he did to others . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.558220997301782	116	|He could almost do it without cutting the book , so that its value for purposes of after sale might not be injured . |	|And yet Mr. Booker was an honest man , and had set his face persistently against many literary malpractices . |	|Stretched-out type , insufficient lines , and the French habit of meandering with a few words over an entire page , had been rebuked by him with conscientious strength . |	1	Mr. Booker
