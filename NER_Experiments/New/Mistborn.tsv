|PART ONE THE SURVIVOR OF HATHSIN I consider myself to be a man of principle . |	DEFAULT									
|But , what man does not ? |										
|Even the cutthroat , I have noticed , considers his actions `` moral '' after a fashion . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Perhaps another person , reading of my life , would name me a religious tyrant . |	DEFAULT									
|He could call me arrogant . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What is to make that man 's opinion any less valid than my own ? |	DEFAULT									
|I guess it all comes down to one fact : In the end , I 'm the one with the armies . |	DEFAULT									
|1 ASH FELL FROM THE SKY . |										
|Vin watched the downy flakes drift through the air . |	Vin									
|Leisurely . |										
|Careless . |										
|Free . |										
|The puffs of soot fell like black snowflakes , descending upon the dark city of Luthadel . |										
|They drifted in corners , blowing in the breeze and curling in tiny whirlwinds over the cobblestones . |										
|They seemed so uncaring . |										
|What would that be like ? |										
|Vin sat quietly in one of the crew 's watch-holes -- a hidden alcove built into the bricks on the side of the safe house . |	Vin									
|From within it , a crewmember could watch the street for signs of danger . |										
|Vin was n't on duty ; the watch-hole was simply one of the few places where she could find solitude.And Vin liked solitude . |	Vin									
|When you 're alone , no one can betray you . |										
|Reen 's words . |	Reen									
|Her brother had taught her so many things , then had reinforced them by doing what he 'd always promised he would -- by betraying her himself . |	Reen	DEFAULT								
|It 's the only way you 'll learn . |	Vin									
|Anyone will betray you , Vin . |	Vin									
|Anyone . |										
|The ash continued to fall . |										
|Sometimes , Vin imagined she was like the ash , or the wind , or the mist itself . |	Vin									
|A thing without thought , capable of simply being , not thinking , caring , or hurting . |										
|Then she could be ... free . |	DEFAULT									
|She heard shuffling a short distance away , then the trapdoor at the back of the small chamber snapped open . |	Vin									
|`` Vin ! '' |	Vin									
|Ulef said , sticking his head into the room . |	Ulef									
|`` There you are ! |	DEFAULT									
|Camon 's been searching for you for a half hour . '' |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|That 's kind of why I hid in the first place . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You should get going , '' Ulef said . |	Ulef	DEFAULT								
|`` The job 's almost ready to begin . '' |										
|Ulef was a gangly boy . |	Ulef									
|Nice , after his own fashion -- naive , if one who had grown up in the underworld could ever really be called `` naive . '' |	Ulef									
|Of course , that did n't mean he would n't betray her . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Betrayal had nothing to do with friendship ; it was a simple fact of survival . |										
|Life was harsh on the streets , and if a skaa thief wanted to keep from being caught and executed , he had to be practical . |										
|And ruthlessness was the very most practical of emotions . |										
|Another of Reen 's sayings . |	Reen									
|`` Well ? '' |										
|Ulef asked . |	Ulef									
|`` You should go . |	DEFAULT									
|Camon 's mad . '' |	Camon									
|When is he not ? |	Camon									
|However , Vin nodded , scrambling out of the cramped -- yet comforting -- confines of the watch-hole . |	Vin									
|She brushed past Ulef and hopped out of the trapdoor , moving into a hallway , then a run-down pantry . |	Vin	Ulef								
|The room was one of many at the back of the store that served as a front for the safe house . |										
|The crew 's lair itself was hidden in a tunneled stone cavern beneath the building . |										
|She left the building through a back door , Ulef trailing behind her . |	DEFAULT	Ulef								
|The job would happen a few blocks away , in a richer section of town . |										
|It was an intricate job -- one of the most complex Vin had ever seen . |	Vin									
|Assuming Camon was n't caught , the payoff would be great indeed . |	Camon									
|If he was caught ... Well , scamming noblemen and obligators was a very dangerous profession -- but it certainly beat working in the forges or the textile mills . |	Camon									
|Vin exited the alleyway , moving out onto a dark , tenement-lined street in one of the city 's many skaa slums . |	Vin									
|Skaa too sick to work lay huddled in corners and gutters , ash drifting around them . |										
|Vin kept her head down and pulled up her cloak 's hood against the still falling flakes . |	Vin									
|Free . |										
|No , I 'll never be free . |	DEFAULT									
|Reen made certain of that when he left . |	Reen									
|`` There you are ! '' |	DEFAULT									
|Camon lifted a squat , fat finger and jabbed it toward her face . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` Where were you ? '' |	Vin									
|Vin did n't let hatred or rebellion show in her eyes . |	Vin									
|She simply looked down , giving Camon what he expected to see . |	Vin	Camon								
|There were other ways to be strong . |										
|That lesson she had learned on her own . |	DEFAULT									
|Camon growled slightly , then raised his hand and backhanded her across the face . |	Camon	Vin								
|The force of the blow threw Vin back against the wall , and her cheek blazed with pain . |	Vin									
|She slumped against the wood , but bore the punishment silently . |	Vin									
|Just another bruise . |										
|She was strong enough to deal with it . |	DEFAULT									
|She 'd done so before . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Listen , '' Camon hissed . |	Camon									
|`` This is an important job . |										
|It 's worth thousands of boxings -- worth more than you a hundred times over . |	DEFAULT									
|I wo n't have you fouling it up . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Understand ? '' |										
|Vin nodded . |	Vin									
|Camon studied her for a moment , his pudgy face red with anger . |	Camon	Vin								
|Finally , he looked away , muttering to himself . |	Camon									
|He was annoyed about something -- something more than just Vin . |	Vin	DEFAULT								
|Perhaps he had heard about the skaa rebellion several days to the north . |	DEFAULT									
|One of the provincial lords , Themos Tresting , had apparently been murdered , his manor burned to the ground . |	Themos Tresting									
|Such disturbances were bad for business ; they made the aristocracy more alert , and less gullible . |										
|That , in turn , could cut seriously into Camon 's profits . |	Camon									
|He 's looking for someone to punish , Vin though . |	Camon	Vin								
|He always gets nervous before a job . |	Camon									
|She looked up at Camon , tasting blood on her lip . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|She must have let some of her confidence show , because he glanced at her out of the corner of his eye , and his expression darkened . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|He raised his hand , as if to strike her again . |	Vin	DEFAULT								
|Vin used up a bit of her Luck . |	Vin									
|She expended just a smidgen ; she 'd need the rest for the job . |	Vin									
|She directed the Luck at Camon , calming his nervousness . |	Camon	Vin								
|The crewleader paused -- oblivious of Vin 's touch , yet feeling its effects nonetheless . |	Camon	Vin								
|He stood for a moment ; then he sighed , turning away and lowering his hand . |	Camon									
|Vin wiped her lip as Camon waddled away . |	Vin	Camon								
|The thiefmaster looked very convincing in his nobleman 's suit . |	Camon									
|It was as rich a costume as Vin had ever seen -- it had a white shirt overlaid by a deep green vest with engraved gold buttons . |	Vin									
|The black suit coat was long , after the current fashion , and he wore a matching black hat . |	DEFAULT									
|His fingers sparkled with rings , and he even carried a fine dueling cane . |	Camon									
|Indeed , Camon did an excellent job of imitating a nobleman ; when it came to playing a role , there were few thieves more competent than Camon . |	Camon									
|Assuming he could keep his temper under control . |	Camon									
|The room itself was less impressive . |										
|Vin pulled herself to her feet as Camon began to snap at some of the other crewmembers . |	Vin	Camon								
|They had rented one of the suites at the top of a local hotel . |										
|Not too lavish -- but that was the idea . |										
|Camon was going to be playing the part of `` Lord Jedue , '' a country nobleman who had hit upon hard financial times and come to Luthadel to get some final , desperate contracts . |	Camon	Lord Jedue								
|The main room had been transformed into a sort of audience chamber , set with a large desk for Camon to sit behind , the walls decorated with cheap pieces of art . |	Camon									
|Two men stood beside the desk , dressed in formal stewards ' clothing ; they would play the part of Camon 's manservants . |	Camon									
|`` What is this ruckus ? '' |										
|a man asked , entering the room . |	DEFAULT									
|He was tall , dressed in a simple gray shirt and a pair of slacks , with a thin sword tied at his waist . |	DEFAULT									
|Theron was the other crewleader -- this particular scam was actually his . |	Theron									
|He 'd brought in Camon as a partner ; he 'd needed someone to play Lord Jedue , and everyone knew that Camon was one of the best . |	DEFAULT	Camon	Lord Jedue							
|Camon looked up . |	Camon									
|`` Hum ? |										
|Ruckus ? |										
|Oh , that was just a minor discipline problem . |										
|Do n't bother yourself , Theron . '' |	Theron									
|Camon punctuated his remark with a dismissive wave of the hand -- there was a reason he played such a good aristocrat . |	Camon									
|He was arrogant enough that he could have been from one of the Great Houses . |	Camon									
|Theron 's eyes narrowed . |	Theron									
|Vin knew what the man was probably thinking : He was deciding how risky it would be to put a knife in Camon 's fat back once the scam was over . |	Vin	Camon	Theron							
|Eventually , the taller crewleader looked away from Camon , glancing at Vin . |	Camon	Vin	DEFAULT							
|`` Who 's this ? '' |										
|he asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Just a member of my crew , '' Camon said . |	Camon									
|`` I thought we did n't need anyone else . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Well , we need her , '' Camon said . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` Ignore her . |	DEFAULT									
|My end of the operation is none of your concern . '' |	Theron	DEFAULT								
|Theron eyed Vin , obviously noting her bloodied lip . |	Theron	Vin								
|She glanced away . |	Vin									
|Theron 's eyes lingered on her , however , running down the length of her body . |	Theron	DEFAULT								
|She wore a simple white buttoned shirt and a pair of overalls . |	DEFAULT									
|Indeed , she was hardly enticing ; scrawny with a youthful face , she supposedly did n't even look her sixteen years . |	DEFAULT									
|Some men preferred such women , however . |										
|She considered using a bit of Luck on him , but eventually he turned away . |	Theron	DEFAULT								
|`` The obligator is nearly here , '' Theron said . |	Theron									
|`` Are you ready ? '' |	Camon									
|Camon rolled his eyes , settling his bulk down into the chair behind the desk . |	Camon									
|`` Everything is perfect . |										
|Leave me be , Theron ! |	Theron									
|Go back to your room and wait . '' |	Theron									
|Theron frowned , then spun and walked from the room , muttering to himself . |	Theron									
|Vin scanned the room , studying the decor , the servants , the atmosphere . |	Vin									
|Finally , she made her way to Camon 's desk . |	Camon	Vin								
|The crewleader sat rifling through a stack of papers , apparently trying to decide which ones to put out on the desktop . |	Camon									
|`` Camon , '' Vin said quietly , `` the servants are too fine . '' |	Camon	Vin								
|Camon frowned , looking up . |	Camon									
|`` What is that you 're babbling ? '' |	Vin									
|`` The servants , '' Vin repeated , still speaking in a soft whisper . |	Vin									
|`` Lord Jedue is supposed to be desperate . |	Lord Jedue									
|He 'd have rich clothing left over from before , but he would n't be able to afford such rich servants . |	Lord Jedue									
|He 'd use skaa . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Camon glared at her , but he paused . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|Physically , there was little difference between noblemen and skaa . |										
|The servants Camon had appointed , however , were dressed as minor noblemen -- they were allowed to wear colorful vests , and they stood a little confidently . |	Camon									
|`` The obligator has to think that you 're nearly impoverished , '' Vin said . |	Camon	Vin								
|`` Pack the room with a lot of skaa servants instead . '' |										
|`` What do you know ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Camon said , scowling at her . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` Enough . '' |										
|She immediately regretted the word ; it sounded too rebellious . |	Vin									
|Camon raised a bejeweled hand , and Vin braced herself for another slap . |	Camon	Vin								
|She could n't afford to use up any more Luck . |	Vin									
|She had precious little remaining anyway . |	DEFAULT									
|However , Camon did n't hit her . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|Instead , he sighed and rested a pudgy hand on her shoulder . |	Vin	Camon								
|`` Why do you insist on provoking me , Vin ? |	DEFAULT	Vin								
|You know the debts your brother left when he ran away . |	Vin	DEFAULT								
|Do you realize that a less merciful man than myself would have sold you to the whoremasters long ago ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|How would you like that , serving in some nobleman 's bed until he grew tired of you and had you executed ? '' |	Vin									
|Vin looked down at her feet . |	Vin									
|Camon 's grip grew tight , his fingers pinching her skin where neck met shoulder , and she gasped in pain despite herself . |	Camon	Vin								
|He grinned at the reaction . |	Camon									
|`` Honestly , I do n't know why I keep you , Vin , '' he said , increasing the pressure of his grip . |	Vin	DEFAULT								
|`` I should have gotten rid of you months ago , when your brother betrayed me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I suppose I just have too kindly a heart . '' |	DEFAULT									
|He finally released her , then pointed for her to stand over by the side of the room , next to a tall indoor plant . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|She did as ordered , orienting herself so she had a good view of the entire room . |	DEFAULT									
|As soon as Camon looked away , she rubbed her shoulder . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|Just another pain . |										
|I can deal with pain . |	Camon									
|Camon sat for a few moments . |	Camon									
|Then , as expected , he waved to the two `` servants '' at his side . |	Camon									
|`` You two ! '' |										
|he said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You 're dressed too richly . |	DEFAULT									
|Go put on something that makes you look like skaa servants instead -- and bring back six more men with you when you come . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Soon , the room was filled as Vin had suggested . |	Vin									
|The obligator arrived a short time later . |										
|Vin watched Prelan Laird step haughtily into the room . |	Vin	Prelan Laird								
|Shaved bald like all obligators , he wore a set of dark gray robes . |	Prelan Laird									
|The Ministry tattoos around his eyes identified him as a prelan , a senior bureaucrat in the Ministry 's Canton of Finance . |	DEFAULT									
|A set of lesser obligators trailed behind him , their eye tattoos far less intricate . |	Prelan Laird									
|Camon rose as the prelan entered , a sign of respect -- something even the highest of Great House noblemen would show to an obligator of Laird 's rank . |	Camon	Prelan Laird								
|Laird gave no bow or acknowledgment of his own , instead striding forward and taking the seat in front of Camon 's desk . |	Prelan Laird	Camon								
|One of the crewmen impersonating a servant rushed forward , bringing chilled wine and fruit for the obligator . |										
|Laird picked at the fruit , letting the servant stand obediently , holding the platter of food as if he were a piece of furniture . |	Prelan Laird	DEFAULT								
|`` Lord Jedue , '' Laird finally said . |	Lord Jedue	Prelan Laird								
|`` I am glad we finally have the opportunity to meet . '' |	Prelan Laird									
|`` As am I , Your Grace , '' Camon said . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` Why is it , again , that you were unable to come to the Canton building , instead requiring that I visit you here ? '' |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` My knees , Your Grace , '' Camon said . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` My physicians recommend that I travel as little as possible . '' |	Camon									
|And you were rightly apprehensive about being drawn into a Ministry stronghold , Vin thought . |	Vin	Prelan Laird								
|`` I see , '' Laird said . |	Prelan Laird									
|`` Bad knees . |										
|An unfortunate attribute in a man who deals in transportation . '' |										
|`` I do n't have to go on the trips , Your Grace , '' Camon said , bowing his head . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` Just organize them . '' |										
|Good , Vin thought . |	Vin									
|Make sure you remain subservient , Camon . |	Camon									
|You need to seem desperate . |	Camon									
|Vin needed this scam to succeed . |	Vin									
|Camon threatened her and he beat her -- but he considered her a good-luck charm . |	Camon	Vin								
|She was n't sure if he knew why his plans went better when she was in the room , but he had apparently made the connection . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|That made her valuable -- and Reen had always said that the surest way to stay alive in the underworld was to make yourself indispensable . |	Reen	DEFAULT								
|`` I see , '' Laird said again . |	Prelan Laird									
|`` Well , I fear that our meeting has come too late for your purposes . |	Prelan Laird	DEFAULT								
|The Canton of Finance has already voted on your proposal . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` So soon ? '' |										
|Camon asked with genuine surprise . |	Camon									
|`` Yes , '' Laird replied , taking a sip of his wine , still not dismissing the servant . |	Prelan Laird									
|`` We have decided not to accept your contract . '' |	Camon									
|Camon sat for a moment , stunned . |	Camon									
|`` I 'm sorry to hear that , Your Grace . '' |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|Laird came to meet you , Vin thought . |	Prelan Laird	Vin	DEFAULT							
|That means he 's still in a position to negotiate . |	Camon									
|`` Indeed , '' Camon continued , seeing what Vin had . |	Camon	Vin								
|`` That is especially unfortunate , as I was ready to make the Ministry an even better offer . '' |	Camon									
|Laird raised a tattooed eyebrow . |	Prelan Laird									
|`` I doubt it will matter . |	Prelan Laird									
|There is an element of the Council who feels that the Canton would receive better service if we found a more stable house to transport our people . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` That would be a grave mistake , '' Camon said smoothly . |	Camon									
|`` Let us be frank , Your Grace . |	DEFAULT									
|We both know that this contract is House Jedue 's last chance . |										
|Now that we 've lost the Farwan deal , we can not afford to run our canal boats to Luthadel anymore . |										
|Without the Ministry 's patronage , my house is financially doomed . '' |	Lord Jedue									
|`` This is doing very little to persuade me , Your Lordship , '' the obligator said . |	Lord Jedue	DEFAULT								
|`` Is n't it ? '' |										
|Camon asked . |	Camon									
|`` Ask yourself this , Your Grace -- who will serve you better ? |	DEFAULT									
|Will it be the house that has dozens of contracts to divide its attention , or the house that views your contract as its last hope ? |	DEFAULT									
|The Canton of Finance will not find a more accommodating partner than a desperate one . |										
|Let my boats be the ones that bring your acolytes down from the north -- let my soldiers escort them -- and you will not be disappointed . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Good , Vin thought . |	Vin									
|`` I ... see , '' the obligator said , now troubled . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I would be willing to give you an extended contract , locked in at the price of fifty boxings a head per trip , Your Grace . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Your acolytes would be able to travel our boats at their leisure , and would always have the escorts they need . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The obligator raised an eyebrow . |	DEFAULT									
|`` That 's half the former fee . '' |										
|`` I told you , '' Camon said . |	Camon	DEFAULT								
|`` We 're desperate . |										
|My house needs to keep its boats running . |	DEFAULT									
|Fifty boxings will not make us a profit , but that does n't matter . |										
|Once we have the Ministry contract to bring us stability , we can find other contracts to fill our coffers . '' |										
|Laird looked thoughtful . |	Prelan Laird									
|It was a fabulous deal -- one that might ordinarily have been suspicious . |										
|However , Camon 's presentation created the image of a house on the brink of financial collapse . |	Camon									
|The other crewleader , Theron , had spent five years building , scamming , and finagling to create this moment . |	Theron									
|The Ministry would be remiss not to consider the opportunity . |										
|Laird was realizing just that . |	Prelan Laird									
|The Steel Ministry was not just the force of bureaucracy and legal authority in the Final Empire -- it was like a noble house unto itself . |										
|The more wealth it had , the better its own mercantile contracts , the more leverage the various Ministry Cantons had with each other -- and with the noble houses . |										
|Laird was still obviously hesitant , however . |	Prelan Laird									
|Vin could see the look in his eyes , the suspicion she knew well . |	Vin	Prelan Laird								
|He was not going to take the contract . |	DEFAULT									
|Now , Vin thought . |	Vin									
|It 's my turn . |	Vin									
|Vin used her Luck on Laird . |	Vin	Prelan Laird								
|She reached out tentatively -- not even really sure what she was doing , or why she could even do it . |	Vin									
|Yet her touch was instinctive , trained through years of subtle practice . |	DEFAULT									
|She 'd been ten years old before she 'd realized that other people could n't do what she could . |	DEFAULT									
|She pressed against Laird 's emotions , dampening them . |	DEFAULT	Prelan Laird								
|He became less suspicious , less afraid . |	Prelan Laird									
|Docile . |										
|His worries melted away , and Vin could see a calm sense of control begin to assert itself in his eyes . |	Vin	Prelan Laird								
|Yet , Laird still seemed slightly uncertain . |	Prelan Laird									
|Vin pushed harder . |	Vin									
|He cocked his head , looking thoughtful . |	DEFAULT									
|He opened his mouth to speak , but she pushed against him again , desperately using up her last pinch of Luck . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He paused again . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Very well , '' he finally said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I will take this new proposal to the Council . |	DEFAULT									
|Perhaps an agreement can still be reached . '' |										
|If men read these words , let them know that power is a heavy burden . |										
|Seek not to be bound by its chains . |										
|The Terris prophecies say that I will have the power to save the world . |	DEFAULT									
|They hint , however , that I will have the power to destroy it as well . |	DEFAULT
