1 THE COLOR OF MAGIC Fire roared through the bifurcated city of Ankh-Morpork . 
Where it licked the Wizards ' Quarter it burned blue and green and was even laced with strange sparks of the eighth color , octarine ; where its outriders found their way into the vats and oil stores all along Merchant Street it progressed in a series of blazing fountains and explosions ; in the streets of the perfume blenders it burned with a sweetness ; where it touched bundles of rare and dry herbs in the storerooms of the drugmasters it made men go mad and talk to God . 
By now the whole of downtown Morpork was alight , and the richer and worthier citizens of Ankh on the far bank were bravely responding to the situation by feverishly demolishing the bridges . 
But already the ships in the Morpork docks -- laden with grain , cotton and timber , and coated with tar -- were blazing merrily and , their moorings burnt to ashes , were breasting the river Ankh on the ebb tide , igniting riverside palaces and bowers as they drifted like drowning fireflies toward the sea . 
In any case , sparks were riding the breeze and touching down far across the river in hidden gardens and remote rickyards . 
The smoke from the merry burning rose miles high , in a wind-sculpted black column that could be seen across the whole of the Discworld . 
It was certainly impressive from the cool , dark hilltop a few leagues away , where two figures were watching with considerable interest . 
The taller of the pair was chewing on a chicken leg and leaning on a sword that was only marginally shorter than the average man . 
If it was n't for the air of wary intelligence about him it might have been supposed that he was a barbarian from the Hubland wastes . 
His partner was much shorter and wrapped from head to toe in a brown cloak . 
Later , when he has occasion to move , it will be seen that he moves lightly , catlike . 
The two had barely exchanged a word in the last twenty minutes except for a short and inconclusive argument as to whether a particularly powerful explosion had been the oil bond store or the workshop of Kerible the Enchanter . 
Money hinged on the fact . 
Now the big man finished gnawing at the bone and tossed it into the grass , smiling ruefully . 
`` There go all those little alleyways , '' he said . 
`` I liked them . '' 
`` All the treasure houses , '' said the small man . 
He added thoughtfully , `` Do gems burn ? 
I wonder . ' 
Tis said they 're kin to coal . '' 
`` All the gold , melting and running down the gutters , '' said the big one , ignoring him . 
`` And all the wine , boiling in the barrels . '' 
`` There were rats , '' said his brown companion . 
`` Rats , I 'll grant you . '' 
`` It was no place to be in high summer . '' 
`` That , too . 
One ca n't help feeling , though , a -- well , a momentary -- '' He trailed off , then brightened . 
`` We owed old Fredor at the Crimson Leech eight silver pieces , '' he added . 
The little man nodded . 
They were silent for a while as a whole new series of explosions carved a red line across a hitherto dark section of the greatest city in the world . 
Then the big man stirred . 
`` Weasel ? '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` I wonder who started it . '' 
The small swordsman known as the Weasel said nothing . 
He was watching the road in the ruddy light . 
Few had come that way since the Deosil Gate had been one of the first to collapse in a shower of white-hot embers . 
But two were coming up it now . 
The Weasel 's eyes , always at their sharpest in gloom and half-light , made out the shapes of two mounted men and some sort of low beast behind them . 
Doubtless a rich merchant escaping with as much treasure as he could lay frantic hands on . 
The Weasel said as much to his companion , who sighed . 
`` The status of footpad ill suits us , '' said the barbarian , `` but , as you say , times are hard and there are no soft beds tonight . '' 
He shifted his grip on his sword and , as the leading rider drew near , stepped out onto the road with a hand held up and his face set in a grin nicely calculated to reassure yet threaten . 
`` Your pardon , sir -- '' he began . 
The rider reined in his horse and drew back his hood . 
The big man looked into a face blotched with superficial burns and punctuated by tufts of singed beard . 
Even the eyebrows had gone . 
`` Bugger off , '' said the face . 
`` You 're Bravd the Hublander , * are n't you ? '' 
Bravd became aware that he had fumbled the initiative . 
`` Just go away , will you ? '' 
said the rider . 
`` I just have n't got time for you , do you understand ? '' 
He looked around and added : `` That goes for your shadow-loving fleabag partner , too , wherever he 's hiding . '' 
The Weasel stepped up to the horse and peered at the disheveled figure . 
`` Why , it 's Rincewind the wizard , is n't it ? '' 
he said in tones of delight , meanwhile filing the wizard 's description of him in his memory for leisurely vengeance . 
`` I thought I recognized the voice . '' 
Bravd spat and sheathed his sword . 
It was seldom worth tangling with wizards , they so rarely had any treasure worth speaking of . 
`` He talks pretty big for a gutter wizard , '' he muttered . 
`` You do n't understand at all , '' said the wizard wearily . 
`` I 'm so scared of you my spine has turned to jelly , it 's just that I 'm suffering from an overdose of terror right now . 
I mean , when I 've got over that then I 'll have time to be decently frightened of you . '' 
The Weasel pointed toward the burning city . 
`` You 've been through that ? '' 
he asked . 
The wizard rubbed a red-raw hand across his eyes . 
`` I was there when it started . 
See him ? 
Back there ? '' 
He pointed back down the road to where his traveling companion was still approaching , having adopted a method of riding that involved falling out of the saddle every few seconds . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Weasel . 
`` He started it , '' said Rincewind simply . 
Bravd and Weasel looked at the figure , now hopping across the road with one foot in a stirrup . 
`` Fire-raiser , is he ? '' 
said Bravd at last . 
`` No , '' said Rincewind . 
`` Not precisely . 
Let 's just say that if complete and utter chaos were lightning , then he 'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armor and shouting ` All gods are bastards . ' 
Got any food ? '' 
`` There 's some chicken , '' said Weasel . 
`` In exchange for a story . '' 
`` What 's his name ? '' 
said Bravd , who tended to lag behind in conversations . 
`` Twoflower . '' 
`` Twoflower ? '' 
said Bravd . 
`` What a funny name . '' 
`` You , '' said Rincewind , dismounting , `` do not know the half of it . 
Chicken , you say ? '' 
`` Deviled , '' said Weasel . 
The wizard groaned . 
`` That reminds me , '' added the Weasel , snapping his fingers , `` there was a really big explosion about , oh , half an hour ago -- '' `` That was the oil bond store going up , '' said Rincewind , wincing at the memory of the burning rain . 
Weasel turned and grinned expectantly at his companion , who grunted and handed over a coin from his pouch . 
Then there was a scream from the roadway , cut off abruptly . 
Rincewind did not look up from his chicken . 
`` One of the things he ca n't do , he ca n't ride a horse , '' he said . 
Then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden recollection , gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into the gloom . 
When he returned , the being called Twoflower was hanging limply over his shoulder . 
It was small and skinny , and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee length britches and a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colors that Weasel 's fastidious eye was offended even in the half-light . 
`` No bones broken , by the feel of things , '' said Rincewind . 
He was breathing heavily . 
Bravd winked at the Weasel and went to investigate the shape that they assumed was a pack animal . 
`` You 'd be wise to forget it , '' said the wizard , without looking up from his examination of the unconscious Twoflower . 
`` Believe me . 
A power protects it . '' 
`` A spell ? '' 
said Weasel , squatting down . 
`` No-oo . 
But magic of a kind , I think . 
Not the usual sort . 
I mean , it can turn gold into copper while at the same time it is still gold , it makes men rich by destroying their possessions , it allows the weak to walk fearlessly among thieves , it passes through the strongest doors to leach the most protected treasuries . 
Even now it has me enslaved -- so that I must follow this madman willynilly and protect him from harm . 
It 's stronger than you , Bravd . 
It is , I think , more cunning even than you , Weasel . '' 
`` What is it called then , this mighty magic ? '' 
Rincewind shrugged . 
`` In our tongue it is called reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits . 
Is there any wine ? '' 
`` You must know that I am not without artifice where magic is concerned , '' said Weasel . 
`` Only last year did I -- assisted by my friend there -- part the notoriously powerful Archmage of Ymitury from his staff , his belt of moon jewels and his life , in that approximate order . 
I do not fear this reflected-sound-of-underground-spirits of which you speak . 
However , '' he added , `` you engage my interest . 
Perhaps you would care to tell me more ? '' 
Bravd looked at the shape on the road . 
It was closer now , and clearer in the pre-dawn light . 
It looked for all the world like a -- `` A box on legs ? '' 
he said . 
`` I 'll tell you about it , '' said Rincewind . 
`` If there 's any wine , that is . '' 
Down in the valley there was a roar and a hiss . 
Someone more thoughtful than the rest had ordered to be shut the big river gates that were at the point where the Ankh flowed out of the twin city . 
Denied its usual egress , the river had burst its banks and was pouring down the fire-ravaged streets . 
Soon the continent of flame became a series of islands , each one growing smaller as the dark tide rose . 
And up from the city of fumes and smoke rose a broiling cloud of steam , covering the stars . 
Weasel thought that it looked like some dark fungus or mushroom .
