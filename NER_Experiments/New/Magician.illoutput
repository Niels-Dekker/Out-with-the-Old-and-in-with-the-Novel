hacking O
through O

it O

thick O

the O

quickly O

Just O
as O
the O
last O

coiled O

a O
splitting O
sound O

from O
directly O
in O

him O

' O
It O

' O

shouted O
down O
to O
the O

standing O
in O
the O
water O
below O

Without O
hesitation O
they O
all O
ran O

The O
cry O

never O
ignored O

The O
bole O
of O
the O
tree O

splitting O
down O
the O
middle O
now O
that O
the O
top O

away O

its O

any O

cause O

the O
half O

he O
launched O
himself O
away O

hit O

back O

trying O

The O
blow O

the O
harder O

down O

with O

him O
outside O

wailing O
the O

The O
amount O
of O
strength O
left O

amazing O

as O
if O

reserve O

out O

He O
led O
them O
across O
the O
compound O

his O

ordered O
them O

Once O
inside O

he O
instructed O
a O
guard O

had O
them O
stand O

old O

inspected O

physician O
set O
about O
