|1 THE COLOR OF MAGIC Fire roared through the bifurcated city of Ankh-Morpork . |										
|Where it licked the Wizards ' Quarter it burned blue and green and was even laced with strange sparks of the eighth color , octarine ; where its outriders found their way into the vats and oil stores all along Merchant Street it progressed in a series of blazing fountains and explosions ; in the streets of the perfume blenders it burned with a sweetness ; where it touched bundles of rare and dry herbs in the storerooms of the drugmasters it made men go mad and talk to God . |										
|By now the whole of downtown Morpork was alight , and the richer and worthier citizens of Ankh on the far bank were bravely responding to the situation by feverishly demolishing the bridges . |										
|But already the ships in the Morpork docks -- laden with grain , cotton and timber , and coated with tar -- were blazing merrily and , their moorings burnt to ashes , were breasting the river Ankh on the ebb tide , igniting riverside palaces and bowers as they drifted like drowning fireflies toward the sea . |										
|In any case , sparks were riding the breeze and touching down far across the river in hidden gardens and remote rickyards . |										
|The smoke from the merry burning rose miles high , in a wind-sculpted black column that could be seen across the whole of the Discworld . |										
|It was certainly impressive from the cool , dark hilltop a few leagues away , where two figures were watching with considerable interest . |										
|The taller of the pair was chewing on a chicken leg and leaning on a sword that was only marginally shorter than the average man . |										
|If it was n't for the air of wary intelligence about him it might have been supposed that he was a barbarian from the Hubland wastes . |	DEFAULT									
|His partner was much shorter and wrapped from head to toe in a brown cloak . |	DEFAULT									
|Later , when he has occasion to move , it will be seen that he moves lightly , catlike . |	DEFAULT									
|The two had barely exchanged a word in the last twenty minutes except for a short and inconclusive argument as to whether a particularly powerful explosion had been the oil bond store or the workshop of Kerible the Enchanter . |	Kerible the Enchanter									
|Money hinged on the fact . |										
|Now the big man finished gnawing at the bone and tossed it into the grass , smiling ruefully . |	DEFAULT									
|`` There go all those little alleyways , '' he said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I liked them . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` All the treasure houses , '' said the small man . |	DEFAULT									
|He added thoughtfully , `` Do gems burn ? |	DEFAULT									
|I wonder . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Tis said they 're kin to coal . '' |										
|`` All the gold , melting and running down the gutters , '' said the big one , ignoring him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` And all the wine , boiling in the barrels . '' |										
|`` There were rats , '' said his brown companion . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Rats , I 'll grant you . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` It was no place to be in high summer . '' |										
|`` That , too . |										
|One ca n't help feeling , though , a -- well , a momentary -- '' He trailed off , then brightened . |	DEFAULT									
|`` We owed old Fredor at the Crimson Leech eight silver pieces , '' he added . |	DEFAULT	Fredor								
|The little man nodded . |	DEFAULT									
|They were silent for a while as a whole new series of explosions carved a red line across a hitherto dark section of the greatest city in the world . |										
|Then the big man stirred . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Weasel ? '' |	Weasel									
|`` Yes ? '' |										
|`` I wonder who started it . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The small swordsman known as the Weasel said nothing . |	Weasel									
|He was watching the road in the ruddy light . |	Weasel									
|Few had come that way since the Deosil Gate had been one of the first to collapse in a shower of white-hot embers . |										
|But two were coming up it now . |										
|The Weasel 's eyes , always at their sharpest in gloom and half-light , made out the shapes of two mounted men and some sort of low beast behind them . |	Weasel									
|Doubtless a rich merchant escaping with as much treasure as he could lay frantic hands on . |										
|The Weasel said as much to his companion , who sighed . |	Weasel	DEFAULT								
|`` The status of footpad ill suits us , '' said the barbarian , `` but , as you say , times are hard and there are no soft beds tonight . '' |	DEFAULT									
|He shifted his grip on his sword and , as the leading rider drew near , stepped out onto the road with a hand held up and his face set in a grin nicely calculated to reassure yet threaten . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Your pardon , sir -- '' he began . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The rider reined in his horse and drew back his hood . |	DEFAULT									
|The big man looked into a face blotched with superficial burns and punctuated by tufts of singed beard . |	DEFAULT									
|Even the eyebrows had gone . |										
|`` Bugger off , '' said the face . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You 're Bravd the Hublander , * are n't you ? '' |	Bravd									
|Bravd became aware that he had fumbled the initiative . |	Bravd									
|`` Just go away , will you ? '' |	Bravd									
|said the rider . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I just have n't got time for you , do you understand ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He looked around and added : `` That goes for your shadow-loving fleabag partner , too , wherever he 's hiding . '' |	Weasel	DEFAULT								
|The Weasel stepped up to the horse and peered at the disheveled figure . |	Weasel									
|`` Why , it 's Rincewind the wizard , is n't it ? '' |	Rincewind									
|he said in tones of delight , meanwhile filing the wizard 's description of him in his memory for leisurely vengeance . |	DEFAULT	Rincewind								
|`` I thought I recognized the voice . '' |	Bravd									
|Bravd spat and sheathed his sword . |	Bravd									
|It was seldom worth tangling with wizards , they so rarely had any treasure worth speaking of . |										
|`` He talks pretty big for a gutter wizard , '' he muttered . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` You do n't understand at all , '' said the wizard wearily . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I 'm so scared of you my spine has turned to jelly , it 's just that I 'm suffering from an overdose of terror right now . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I mean , when I 've got over that then I 'll have time to be decently frightened of you . '' |	Weasel	DEFAULT								
|The Weasel pointed toward the burning city . |	Weasel									
|`` You 've been through that ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|he asked . |	DEFAULT									
|The wizard rubbed a red-raw hand across his eyes . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I was there when it started . |	DEFAULT									
|See him ? |	DEFAULT									
|Back there ? '' |										
|He pointed back down the road to where his traveling companion was still approaching , having adopted a method of riding that involved falling out of the saddle every few seconds . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Well ? '' |										
|said Weasel . |	Weasel									
|`` He started it , '' said Rincewind simply . |	Rincewind	DEFAULT								
|Bravd and Weasel looked at the figure , now hopping across the road with one foot in a stirrup . |	Bravd	Weasel	Rincewind							
|`` Fire-raiser , is he ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|said Bravd at last . |	Bravd									
|`` No , '' said Rincewind . |	Rincewind									
|`` Not precisely . |										
|Let 's just say that if complete and utter chaos were lightning , then he 'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armor and shouting ` All gods are bastards . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Got any food ? '' |										
|`` There 's some chicken , '' said Weasel . |	Weasel									
|`` In exchange for a story . '' |										
|`` What 's his name ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|said Bravd , who tended to lag behind in conversations . |	Bravd									
|`` Twoflower . '' |	Twoflower									
|`` Twoflower ? '' |	Twoflower									
|said Bravd . |	Bravd									
|`` What a funny name . '' |										
|`` You , '' said Rincewind , dismounting , `` do not know the half of it . |	Rincewind	DEFAULT								
|Chicken , you say ? '' |	Weasel									
|`` Deviled , '' said Weasel . |	Weasel									
|The wizard groaned . |	DEFAULT									
|`` That reminds me , '' added the Weasel , snapping his fingers , `` there was a really big explosion about , oh , half an hour ago -- '' `` That was the oil bond store going up , '' said Rincewind , wincing at the memory of the burning rain . |	Weasel	Rincewind								
|Weasel turned and grinned expectantly at his companion , who grunted and handed over a coin from his pouch . |	Weasel	DEFAULT								
|Then there was a scream from the roadway , cut off abruptly . |										
|Rincewind did not look up from his chicken . |	Rincewind									
|`` One of the things he ca n't do , he ca n't ride a horse , '' he said . |	Rincewind	DEFAULT								
|Then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden recollection , gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into the gloom . |	DEFAULT									
|When he returned , the being called Twoflower was hanging limply over his shoulder . |	DEFAULT	Twoflower								
|It was small and skinny , and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee length britches and a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colors that Weasel 's fastidious eye was offended even in the half-light . |	Weasel									
|`` No bones broken , by the feel of things , '' said Rincewind . |	Rincewind									
|He was breathing heavily . |	Rincewind									
|Bravd winked at the Weasel and went to investigate the shape that they assumed was a pack animal . |	Bravd	Weasel								
|`` You 'd be wise to forget it , '' said the wizard , without looking up from his examination of the unconscious Twoflower . |	Bravd	DEFAULT	Twoflower							
|`` Believe me . |	DEFAULT									
|A power protects it . '' |										
|`` A spell ? '' |										
|said Weasel , squatting down . |	Weasel									
|`` No-oo . |										
|But magic of a kind , I think . |	DEFAULT									
|Not the usual sort . |										
|I mean , it can turn gold into copper while at the same time it is still gold , it makes men rich by destroying their possessions , it allows the weak to walk fearlessly among thieves , it passes through the strongest doors to leach the most protected treasuries . |	DEFAULT									
|Even now it has me enslaved -- so that I must follow this madman willynilly and protect him from harm . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It 's stronger than you , Bravd . |	Bravd									
|It is , I think , more cunning even than you , Weasel . '' |	DEFAULT	Weasel								
|`` What is it called then , this mighty magic ? '' |										
|Rincewind shrugged . |	Rincewind									
|`` In our tongue it is called reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits . |										
|Is there any wine ? '' |										
|`` You must know that I am not without artifice where magic is concerned , '' said Weasel . |	Weasel	DEFAULT								
|`` Only last year did I -- assisted by my friend there -- part the notoriously powerful Archmage of Ymitury from his staff , his belt of moon jewels and his life , in that approximate order . |	Weasel	Archmage of Ymitury	DEFAULT							
|I do not fear this reflected-sound-of-underground-spirits of which you speak . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|However , '' he added , `` you engage my interest . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Perhaps you would care to tell me more ? '' |	Bravd	DEFAULT								
|Bravd looked at the shape on the road . |	Bravd									
|It was closer now , and clearer in the pre-dawn light . |										
|It looked for all the world like a -- `` A box on legs ? '' |										
|he said . |	Rincewind									
|`` I 'll tell you about it , '' said Rincewind . |	Rincewind	DEFAULT								
|`` If there 's any wine , that is . '' |										
|Down in the valley there was a roar and a hiss . |										
|Someone more thoughtful than the rest had ordered to be shut the big river gates that were at the point where the Ankh flowed out of the twin city . |										
|Denied its usual egress , the river had burst its banks and was pouring down the fire-ravaged streets . |										
|Soon the continent of flame became a series of islands , each one growing smaller as the dark tide rose . |										
|And up from the city of fumes and smoke rose a broiling cloud of steam , covering the stars . |										
|Weasel thought that it looked like some dark fungus or mushroom . |	Weasel
