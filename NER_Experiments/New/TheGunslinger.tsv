|The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts , huge , standing to the sky for what might have been parsecs in all directions . |										
|White ; blinding ; waterless ; without feature save for the faint , cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams , nightmares , death . |										
|An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way , for once the drifted track that cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been a highway and coaches had followed it . |										
|The world had moved on since then . |										
|The world had emptied . |										
|The gunslinger walked stolidly , not hurrying , not loafing . |	DEFAULT									
|A hide waterbag was slung around his middle like a bloated sausage . |	DEFAULT									
|It was almost full . |										
|He had progressed through the khef over many years , and had reached the fifth level . |	DEFAULT									
|At the seventh or eighth , he would not have been thirsty ; he could have watched own body dehydrate with clinical , detached attention , watering its crevices and dark inner hollows only when his logic told him it must be done . |	DEFAULT									
|He was not seventh or eighth . |	DEFAULT									
|He was fifth . |	DEFAULT									
|So he was thirsty , although he had no particular urge to drink . |	DEFAULT									
|In a vague way , all this pleased him . |	DEFAULT									
|It was romantic . |										
|Below the waterbag were his guns , finely weighted to his hand . |	DEFAULT									
|The two belts crisscrossed above his crotch . |	DEFAULT									
|The holsters were oiled too deeply for even this Philistine sun to crack . |										
|The stocks of the guns were sandalwood , yellow and finely grained . |										
|The holsters were tied down with rawhide cord , and they swung heavily against his hips . |	DEFAULT									
|The brass casings of the cartridges looped into the gun belts twinkled and flashed and heliographed in the sun . |										
|The leather made subtle creaking noises . |										
|The guns themselves made no noise . |										
|They had spilled blood . |										
|There was no need to make noise in the sterility of the desert His clothes were the no-color of rain or dust . |	DEFAULT									
|His shirt was open at the throat , with a rawhide thong dangling loosely in hand-punched eyelets . |	DEFAULT									
|His pants were seam-stretched dungarees . |	DEFAULT									
|He breasted a gently rising dune -LRB- although there was no sand here ; the desert was hardpan , and even the harsh winds that blew when dark came raised only an aggravating harsh dust like scouring powder -RRB- and saw the kicked remains of a tiny campfire on the lee side , the side which the sun would quit earliest . |	DEFAULT									
|Small signs like this , once more affirming the man in black 's essential humanity , never failed to please him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His lips stretched in the pitted , flaked remains of his face . |	DEFAULT									
|He squatted . |	DEFAULT									
|He had burned the devil-grass , of course . |	DEFAULT									
|It was the only thing out here that would burn . |										
|It burned with a greasy , flat light , and it burned slow . |										
|Border dwellers had told him that devils lived even in the flames . |	DEFAULT									
|They burned it but would not look into the light . |										
|They said the devils hypnotized , beckoned , would eventually draw the one who looked into the fires . |										
|And the next man foolish enough to look into the fire might see you . |	DEFAULT									
|The burned grass was crisscrossed in the now-familiar ideographic pattern , and crumbled to gray senselessness before the gunslinger 's prodding hand . |	DEFAULT									
|There was nothing in the remains but a charred scrap of bacon , which he ate thoughtfully . |	DEFAULT									
|It had always been this way . |										
|The gunslinger had followed the man in black across the desert for two months now , across the endless , screamingly monotonous purgatorial wastes , and had yet to find spoor other than the hygienic sterile ideographs of the man in black 's campfires . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He had not found a can , a bottle , or a waterbag -LRB- the gunslinger had left four of those behind , like dead snake-skins -RRB- . |	DEFAULT									
|-- Perhaps the campfires are a message , spelled out letter by letter . |										
|Take a powder . |										
|Or , the end draweth nigh . |										
|Or maybe even , Eat at Joe 's . |										
|It did n't matter . |										
|He had no understanding of the ideograms , if they were ideograms . |	DEFAULT									
|And the remains were as cold as all the others . |										
|He knew he was closer , but did not know how he knew . |	DEFAULT									
|That did n't matter either . |										
|He stood up , brushing his hands . |	DEFAULT									
|No other trace ; the wind , razor-sharp , had of course filed away even what scant tracks the hardpan held . |										
|He had never even been able to find his quarry 's droppings . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Nothing . |										
|Only these cold campfires along the ancient highway and the relentless range-finder in his own head . |										
|He sat down and allowed himself a short pull from the waterbag . |	DEFAULT									
|He scanned the desert , looked up at the sun , which was now sliding down the far quadrant of the sky . |	DEFAULT									
|He got up , removed his gloves from his belt , and began to pull devil-grass for his own fire , which he laid over the ashes the man in black had left . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He found the irony , like the romance of his thirst , bitterly appealing . |	DEFAULT									
|He did not use the flint and steel until the remains of the day were only the fugitive heat in the ground beneath him and a sardonic orange line on the monochrome western horizon . |	DEFAULT									
|He watched the south patiently , toward the mountains , not hoping or expecting to see the thin straight line of smoke from a new campfire , but merely watching because that was a part of it . |	DEFAULT									
|There was nothing . |										
|He was close , but only relatively so . |	DEFAULT									
|Not close enough to see smoke at dusk . |										
|He struck his spark to the dry , shredded grass and lay down upwind , letting the dreamsmoke blow out toward the waste . |	DEFAULT									
|The wind , except for occasional gyrating dust devils , was constant . |										
|Above , the stars were unwinking , also constant . |										
|Suns and worlds by the million . |										
|Dizzying constellations , cold fire in every primary hue . |										
|As he watched , the sky washed from violet to ebony . |	DEFAULT									
|A meteor etched a brief , spectacular arc and winked out . |										
|The fire threw strange shadows as the devil-grass burned its slow way down into new patterns -- not ideograms but a straightforward crisscross vaguely frightening in its own no-nonsense surety . |										
|He had laid his fuel in a pattern that was not artful but only workable . |	DEFAULT									
|It spoke of blacks and whites . |										
|It spoke of a man who might straighten bad pictures in strange hotel rooms . |										
|The fire burned its steady , slow flame , and phantoms danced in its incandescent core . |										
|The gunslinger did not see . |	DEFAULT									
|He slept . |	DEFAULT									
|The two patterns , art and craft , were welded together . |										
|The wind moaned . |										
|Every now and then a perverse downdraft would make the smoke whirl and eddy toward him , and sporadic whiffs of the smoke touched him . |	DEFAULT									
|They built dreams in the same way that a small irritant may build a pearl . |										
|II He had come down off the last of the foothills leading the donkey , whose eyes were already dead and bulging with the heat . |	DEFAULT									
|He had passed the last town three weeks before , and since then there had only been the deserted coach track and an occasional huddle of border dwellers ' sod dwellings . |	DEFAULT									
|The huddles had degenerated into single dwellings , most inhabited by lepers or madmen . |										
|He found the madmen better company . |	DEFAULT									
|One had given him a stainless steel Silva compass and bade him give it to Jesus . |	DEFAULT									
|The gunslinger took it gravely . |	DEFAULT									
|If he saw Him , he would turn over the compass . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He did not expect to . |	DEFAULT									
|Five days had passed since the last hut , and he had begun to suspect there would be no more when he topped the last eroded hill and saw the familiar low-backed sod roof . |	DEFAULT									
|The dweller , a surprisingly young man with a wild shock of strawberry hair that reached almost to his waist , was weeding a scrawny stand of corn with zealous abandon . |	DEFAULT									
|The mule let out a wheezing grunt and the dweller looked up , glaring blue eyes coming target-center on the gunslinger in a moment He raised both hands in curt salute and then bent to the corn again , humping up the row next to his hut with back bent , tossing devil-grass and an occasional stunted corn plant over his shoulder . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His hair flopped and flew in the wind that now came directly from the desert , with nothing to break it . |	DEFAULT									
|The gunslinger came down the hill slowly , leading the donkey on which his waterskins sloshed . |	DEFAULT									
|He paused by the edge of the lifeless-looking cornpatch , drew a drink from one of his skins to start the saliva , and spatinto the arid soil . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Life for your crop . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Life for your own , '' the dweller answered and stood up . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His back popped audibly . |	DEFAULT									
|He surveyed the gunslinger without fear . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The little of his face visible between beard and hair seemed unmarked by the rot , and his eyes , while a bit wild , seemed sane . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I do n't have anything but corn and beans , '' he said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Corn 's free , but you 'll have to kick something in for the beans . |	DEFAULT									
|A man brings them out once in a while . |										
|He do n't stay long . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The dweller laughed shortly . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Afraid of spirits . '' |										
|`` I expect he thinks you 're one . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I expect he does . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They looked at each other in silence for a moment . |										
|The dweller put out his hand . |	Brown									
|`` Brown is my name . '' |	Brown									
|The gunslinger shook his hand . |	DEFAULT									
|As he did so , a scrawny raven croaked from the low peak of the sod roof . |	DEFAULT									
|The dweller gestured at it briefly : `` That 's Zoltan . '' |	Brown	Zoltan								
|At the sound of its name the raven croaked again and flew across to Brown . |	Brown	Zoltan								
|It landed on the dweller 's head and roosted , talons firmly twined in the wild thatch of hair . |										
|`` Screw you , '' Zoltan croaked brightly . |	DEFAULT	Zoltan								
|`` Screw you and the horse you rode in on . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The gunslinger nodded amiably . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Beans , beans , the musical fruit , '' the raven recited , inspired . |										
|`` The more you eat , the more you toot '' `` You teach him that ? '' |	Brown	DEFAULT								
|`` That 's all he wants to learn , I guess , '' Brown said . |	DEFAULT	Brown								
|`` Tried to teach him The Lord 's Prayer once . '' |	DEFAULT									
|His eyes traveled out beyond the hut for a moment , toward the gritty , featureless hardpan . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Guess this ai n't Lord 's Prayer country . |										
|You 're a gunslinger . |	DEFAULT									
|That right ? '' |										
|`` Yes . '' |										
|He hunkered down and brought out his makings . |	DEFAULT									
|Zoltan launched himself from Brown 's head and landed , flittering , on the gunslinger 's shoulder . |	Zoltan	Brown								
|`` After the other one , I guess . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Yes . '' |										
|The inevitable question formed in his mouth : `` How long since he passed by ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Brown shrugged . |	Brown									
|`` I do n't know . |	Brown									
|Time 's funny out here . |										
|More than two weeks . |										
|Less than two months . |										
|The bean man 's been twice since he passed . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'd guess six weeks . |	DEFAULT									
|That 's probably wrong . '' |										
|`` The more you eat , the more you toot , '' Zoltan said . |	DEFAULT	Zoltan								
|`` Did he stop off ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|the gunslinger asked . |	DEFAULT									
|Brown nodded . |	Brown									
|`` He stayed supper , same as you will , I guess . |	Brown	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|We passed the time . '' |										
|The gunslinger stood up and the bird flew back to the roof , squawking . |	DEFAULT									
|He felt an odd , trembling eagerness . |	DEFAULT									
|`` What did he talk about ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Brown cocked an eyebrow at him . |	Brown	DEFAULT								
|`` Not much . |										
|Did it ever rain and when did I come here and had I buried my wife . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I did most of the talking , which ai n't usual . '' |	DEFAULT									
|He paused . |	DEFAULT									
|and the only sound was the stark wind . |										
|`` He 's a sorcerer , ai n't he ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Yes . '' |										
|Brown nodded slowly . |	Brown									
|`` I knew . |	Brown									
|Are you ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I 'm just a man . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` You 'll never catch him . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I 'll catch him . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They looked at each other , a sudden depth of feeling between them , the dweller upon his dust-puff-dry ground , the gunslinger on the hardpan that shelved down to the desert . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He reached for his flint . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Here . '' |										
|Brown produced a sulfur-headed match and struck it with a grimed nail . |	Brown									
|The gunslinger pushed the tip of his smoke into the flame and drew . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Thanks . '' |										
|`` You 'll want to fill your skins , '' the dweller said , turning away . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Spring 's under the eaves in back . |										
|I 'll start dinner . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The gunslinger stepped gingerly over the rows of corn and went around back . |	DEFAULT									
|The spring was at the bottom of a hand-dug well , lined with stones to keep the powdery earth from caving . |										
|As he descended the rickety ladder , the gunslinger reflected that the stones must represent two years ' work easily -- hauling , dragging , laying . |	DEFAULT									
|The water was clear but slow-moving , and filling the skins was a long chore . |										
|While he was topping the second , Zoltan perched on the lip of the well . |	DEFAULT	Zoltan								
|`` Screw you and the horse you rode in on , '' he advised . |	Zoltan	DEFAULT								
|He looked up , startled . |	DEFAULT									
|The shaft was about fifteen feet deep : easy enough for Brown to drop a rock on him , break his head , and steal everything on him . |	Brown	DEFAULT								
|A crazy or a rotter would n't do it ; Brown was neither . |	Brown									
|Yet he liked Brown , and so he pushed the thought out of his mind and got the rest of his water . |	DEFAULT	Brown								
|What came , came . |										
|When he came through the hut 's door and walked down the steps -LRB- the hovel proper was set below ground level , designed to catch and hold the coolness of the nights -RRB- , Brown was poking ears of corn into the embers of a tiny fire with a hardwood spatula . |	DEFAULT	Brown								
|Two ragged plates had been set at opposite ends of a dun blanket . |										
|Water for the beans was just beginning to bubble in a pot hung over the fire . |										
|`` I 'll pay for the water , too . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Brown did not look up . |	Brown									
|`` The water 's a gift from God . |										
|Pappa Doc brings the beans . '' |	Pappa Doc									
|The gunslinger grunted a laugh and sat down with his back against one rude wall , folded his arms and closed his eyes . |	DEFAULT									
|After a little , the smell of roasting corn came to his nose . |	DEFAULT									
|There was a pebbly rattle as Brown dumped a paper of dry beans into the pot An occasional tak-tak-tak as Zoltan walked restlessly on the roof . |	Brown	Zoltan								
|He was tired ; he had been going sixteen and sometimes eighteen hours a day between here and the horror that had occurred in Tull , the last village . |	Brown									
|And he had been afoot for the last twelve days ; the mule was at the end of its endurance . |	DEFAULT									
|Tak-tak-tak . |										
|Two weeks , Brown had said , or as much as six . |	Brown									
|Did n't matter . |										
|There had been calendars in Tull , and they had remembered the man in black because of the old man he had healed on his way through . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|Just an old man dying with the weed . |	DEFAULT									
|An old man of thirty-five . |	DEFAULT									
|And if Brown was right , the man in black had lost ground since then . |	Brown	DEFAULT								
|But the desert was next . |										
|And the desert would be hell . |										
|Tak-tak-tak . |										
|-- Lend me your wings , bird . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'll spread them and fly on the thermals . |	DEFAULT									
|He slept III Brown woke him up five hours later . |	DEFAULT	Brown								
|It was dark . |										
|The only light was the dull cherry glare of the banked embers . |										
|`` Your mule has passed on , '' Brown said . |	Brown									
|`` Dinner 's ready . '' |										
|`` How ? '' |										
|Brown shrugged . |	Brown									
|`` Roasted and boiled , how else ? |										
|You picky ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` No , the mule . '' |										
|`` It just laid over , that 's all . |										
|It looked like an old mule . '' |										
|And with a touch of apology : `` Zoltan et the eyes . '' |	Zoltan									
|`` Oh . '' |										
|He might have expected it `` All right '' Brown surprised him again when they sat down to the blanket that served as a table by asking a brief blessing : Rain , health , expansion to the spirit `` Do you believe in an afterlife ? '' |	DEFAULT	Brown								
|The gunslinger asked him as Brown dropped three ears of hot corn onto his plate . |	DEFAULT	Brown								
|Brown nodded . |	Brown									
|`` I think this is it . '' |
