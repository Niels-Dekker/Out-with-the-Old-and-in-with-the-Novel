CHAPTER ONE A Place for Demons IT WAS FELLING NIGHT , and the usual crowd had gathered at the Waystone Inn . 
Five was n't much of a crowd , but five was as many as the Waystone ever saw these days , times being what they were . 
Old Cob was filling his role as storyteller and advice dispensary . 
The men at the bar sipped their drinks and listened . 
In the back room a young innkeeper stood out of sight behind the door , smiling as he listened to the details of a familiar story . 
`` When he awoke , Taborlin the Great found himself locked in a high tower . 
They had taken his sword and stripped him of his tools : key , coin , and candle were all gone . 
But that were n't even the worst of it , you see ... '' Cob paused for effect , `` ... cause the lamps on the wall were burning blue ! '' 
Graham , Jake , and Shep nodded to themselves . 
The three friends had grown up together , listening to Cob 's stories and ignoring his advice . 
Cob peered closely at the newer , more attentive member of his small audience , the smith 's prentice . 
`` Do you know what that meant , boy ? '' 
Everyone called the smith 's prentice `` boy '' despite the fact that he was a hand taller than anyone there . 
Small towns being what they are , he would most likely remain `` boy '' until his beard filled out or he bloodied someone 's nose over the matter . 
The boy gave a slow nod . 
`` The Chandrian . '' 
`` That 's right , '' Cob said approvingly . 
`` The Chandrian . 
Everyone knows that blue fire is one of their signs . 
Now he was -- '' `` But how 'd they find him ? '' 
the boy interrupted . 
`` And why di n't they kill him when they had the chance ? '' 
`` Hush now , you 'll get all the answers before the end , '' Jake said . 
`` Just let him tell it . '' 
`` No need for all that , Jake , '' Graham said . 
`` Boy 's just curious . 
Drink your drink . '' 
`` I drank me drink already , '' Jake grumbled . 
`` I need t â€™n other but the innkeep 's still skinning rats in the back room . '' 
He raised his voice and knocked his empty mug hollowly on the top of the mahogany bar . 
`` Hoy ! 
We 're thirsty men in here ! '' 
The innkeeper appeared with five bowls of stew and two warm , round loaves of bread . 
He pulled more beer for Jake , Shep , and Old Cob , moving with an air of bustling efficiency . 
The story was set aside while the men tended to their dinners . 
Old Cob tucked away his bowl of stew with the predatory efficiency of a lifetime bachelor . 
The others were still blowing steam off their bowls when he finished the last of his loaf and returned to his story . 
`` Now Taborlin needed to escape , but when he looked around , he saw his cell had no door . 
No windows . 
All around him was nothing but smooth , hard stone . 
It was a cell no man had ever escaped . 
`` But Taborlin knew the names of all things , and so all things were his to command . 
He said to the stone : ` Break ! ' 
and the stone broke . 
The wall tore like a piece of paper , and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and breathe the sweet spring air . 
He stepped to the edge , looked down , and without a second thought he stepped out into the open air ... . '' 
The boy 's eyes went wide . 
`` He did n't ! '' 
Cob nodded seriously . 
`` So Taborlin fell , but he did not despair . 
For he knew the name of the wind , and so the wind obeyed him . 
He spoke to the wind and it cradled and caressed him . 
It bore him to the ground as gently as a puff of thistledown and set him on his feet softly as a mother 's kiss . 
`` And when he got to the ground and felt his side where they 'd stabbed him , he saw that it were n't hardly a scratch . 
Now maybe it was just a piece of luck , '' Cob tapped the side of his nose knowingly . 
`` Or maybe it had something to do with the amulet he was wearing under his shirt . '' 
`` What amulet ? '' 
the boy asked eagerly through a mouthful of stew . 
Old Cob leaned back on his stool , glad for the chance to elaborate . 
`` A few days earlier , Taborlin had met a tinker on the road . 
And even though Taborlin did n't have much to eat , he shared his dinner with the old man . '' 
`` Right sensible thing to do , '' Graham said quietly to the boy . 
`` Everyone knows : ` A tinker pays for kindness twice . ' '' 
`` No no , '' Jake grumbled . 
`` Get it right : ` A tinker 's advice pays kindness twice . ' '' 
The innkeeper spoke up for the first time that night . 
`` Actually , you 're missing more than half , '' he said , standing in the doorway behind the bar . 
`` A tinker 's debt is always paid : Once for any simple trade . 
Twice for freely-given aid . 
Thrice for any insult made . '' 
The men at the bar seemed almost surprised to see Kote standing there . 
They 'd been coming to the Waystone every Felling night for months and Kote had never interjected anything of his own before . 
Not that you could expect anything else , really . 
He 'd only been in town for a year or so . 
He was still a stranger . 
The smith 's prentice had lived here since he was eleven , and he was still referred to as `` that Rannish boy , '' as if Rannish were some foreign country and not a town less than thirty miles away . 
`` Just something I heard once , '' Kote said to fill the silence , obviously embarrassed . 
Old Cob nodded before he cleared his throat and launched back into the story . 
`` Now this amulet was worth a whole bucket of gold nobles , but on account of Taborlin 's kindness , the tinker sold it to him for nothing but an iron penny , a copper penny , and a silver penny . 
It was black as a winter night and cold as ice to touch , but so long as it was round his neck , Taborlin would be safe from the harm of evil things . 
Demons and such . '' 
`` I 'd give a good piece for such a thing these days , '' Shep said darkly . 
He had drunk most and talked least over the course of the evening . 
Everyone knew that something bad had happened out on his farm last Cendling night , but since they were good friends they knew better than to press him for the details . 
At least not this early in the evening , not as sober as they were . 
`` Aye , who would n't ? '' 
Old Cob said judiciously , taking a long drink . 
`` I di n't know the Chandrian were demons , '' the boy said . 
`` I 'd heard -- '' `` They ai n't demons , '' Jake said firmly . 
`` They were the first six people to refuse Tehlu 's choice of the path , and he cursed them to wander the corners -- '' `` Are you telling this story , Jacob Walker ? '' 
Cob said sharply . 
`` Cause if you are , I 'll just let you get on with it . '' 
The two men glared at each other for a long moment . 
Eventually Jake looked away , muttering something that could , conceivably , have been an apology . 
Cob turned back to the boy . 
`` That 's the mystery of the Chandrian , '' he explained . 
`` Where do they come from ? 
Where do they go after they 've done their bloody deeds ? 
Are they men who sold their souls ? 
Demons ? 
Spirits ? 
No one knows . '' 
Cob shot Jake a profoundly disdainful look . 
`` Though every half-wit claims he knows ... . '' 
The story fell further into bickering at this point , about the nature of the Chandrian , the signs that showed their presence to the wary , and whether the amulet would protect Taborlin from bandits , or mad dogs , or falling off a horse . 
Things were getting heated when the front door banged open . 
Jake looked over . 
`` It 's about time you got in , Carter . 
Tell this damn fool the difference between a demon and a dog . 
Everybody kn -- '' Jake stopped midsentence and rushed to the door . 
`` God 's body , what happened to you ? '' 
Carter stepped into the light , his face pale and smeared with blood . 
He clutched an old saddle blanket to his chest . 
It was an odd , awkward shape , as if it were wrapped around a tangle of kindling sticks . 
His friends jumped off their stools and hurried over at the sight of him . 
`` I 'm fine , '' he said as he made his slow way into the common room . 
His eyes were wild around the edges , like a skittish horse . 
`` I 'm fine . 
I 'm fine . '' 
He dropped the bundled blanket onto the nearest table where it knocked hard against the wood , as if it were full of stones . 
His clothes were crisscrossed with long , straight cuts . 
His grey shirt hung in loose tatters except where it was stuck to his body , stained a dark , sullen red . 
Graham tried to ease him into a chair . 
`` Mother of God . 
Sit down , Carter . 
What happened to you ? 
Sit down . '' 
Carter shook his head stubbornly . 
`` I told you , I 'm fine . 
I 'm not hurt that bad . '' 
`` How many were there ? '' 
Graham said . 
`` One , '' Carter said . 
`` But it 's not what you think -- '' `` Goddammit . 
I told you , Carter , '' Old Cob burst out with the sort of frightened anger only relatives and close friends can muster . 
`` I told you for months now . 
You ca n't go out alone . 
Not even as far as Baedn . 
It ai n't safe . '' 
Jake laid a hand on the old man 's arm , quieting him . 
`` Just take a sit , '' Graham said , still trying to steer Carter into a chair . 
`` Let 's get that shirt off you and get you cleaned up . '' 
Carter shook his head . 
`` I 'm fine . 
I got cut up a little , but the blood is mostly Nelly 's . 
It jumped on her . 
Killed her about two miles outside town , past the Oldstone Bridge . '' 
A moment of serious silence followed the news . 
The smith 's prentice laid a sympathetic hand on Carter 's shoulder . 
`` Damn . 
That 's hard . 
She was gentle as a lamb , too . 
Never tried to bite or kick when you brought her in for shoes . 
Best horse in town . 
Damn . 
I 'm ... '' He trailed off . 
`` Damn . 
I do n't know what to say . '' 
He looked around helplessly . 
Cob finally managed to free himself from Jake . 
`` I told you , '' he repeated , shaking a finger in Carter 's direction . 
`` There 's folks out lately that would kill you for a pair of pennies , let alone a horse and cart . 
What are you going to do now ? 
Pull it yourself ? '' 
There was a moment of uncomfortable quiet . 
Jake and Cob glared at each other while the rest seemed at a loss for words , unsure of how to comfort their friend . 
The innkeeper moved carefully through the silence . 
Arms full , he stepped nimbly around Shep and began to arrange some items on a nearby table : a bowl of hot water , shears , some clean linen , a few glass bottles , needle and gut . 
`` This never would have happened if he 'd listened to me in the first place , '' Old Cob muttered . 
Jake tried to quiet him , but Cob brushed him aside . 
`` I 'm just tellin ' the truth . 
It 's a damn shame about Nelly , but he better listen now or he 'll end up dead . 
You do n't get lucky twice with those sort of men . '' 
Carter 's mouth made a thin line . 
He reached out and pulled the edge of the bloody blanket . 
Whatever was inside flipped over once and snagged on the cloth . 
Carter tugged harder and there was a clatter like a bag of flat river stones upended onto the tabletop . 
It was a spider as large as a wagon wheel , black as slate . 
The smith 's prentice jumped backward and hit a table , knocking it over and almost falling to the ground himself . 
Cob 's face went slack . 
Graham , Shep , and Jake made wordless , startled sounds and moved away , raising their hands to their faces . 
Carter took a step backward that was almost like a nervous twitch . 
Silence filled the room like a cold sweat . 
The innkeeper frowned . 
`` They ca n't have made it this far west yet , '' he said softly . 
If not for the silence , it is unlikely anyone would have heard him . 
But they did . 
Their eyes pulled away from the thing on the table to stare mutely at the red-haired man . 
Jake found his voice first . 
`` You know what this is ? '' 
The innkeeper 's eyes were distant . 
`` Scrael , '' he said distractedly . 
`` I 'd thought the mountains -- '' `` Scrael ? '' 
Jake broke in . 
`` Blackened body of God , Kote . 
You 've seen these things before ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
The red-haired innkeeper looked up sharply , as if suddenly remembering where he was . 
`` Oh . 
No . 
No , of course not . '' 
Seeing that he was the only one within arm 's length of the dark thing , he took a measured step away . 
`` Just something I heard . '' 
They stared at him . 
`` Do you remember the trader that came through about two span ago ? '' 
They all nodded . 
`` Bastard tried to charge me ten pennies for a half-pound of salt , '' Cob said reflexively , repeating the complaint for perhaps the hundredth time . 
`` Wish I 'd bought some , '' Jake mumbled . 
Graham nodded a silent agreement . 
`` He was a filthy shim , '' Cob spat , seeming to find comfort in the familiar words . 
`` I might pay two in a tight time , but ten is robbery . '' 
`` Not if there are more of those on the road , '' Shep said darkly . 
All eyes went back to the thing on the table . 
`` He told me he 'd heard of them over near Melcombe , '' Kote said quickly , watching everyone 's faces as they studied the thing on the table . 
`` I thought he was just trying to drive up his prices . '' 
`` What else did he say ? '' 
Carter asked . 
The innkeeper looked thoughtful for a moment , then shrugged . 
`` I did n't get the whole story . 
He was only in town for a couple hours . '' 
`` I do n't like spiders , '' the smith 's prentice said . 
He remained on the other side of a table some fifteen feet away . 
`` Cover it up . '' 
`` It 's not a spider , '' Jake said . 
`` It 's got no eyes . '' 
`` It 's got no mouth either , '' Carter pointed out . 
`` How does it eat ? '' 
`` What does it eat ? '' 
Shep said darkly . 
The innkeeper continued to eye the thing curiously . 
He leaned closer , stretching out a hand . 
Everyone edged even farther away from the table . 
`` Careful , '' Carter said . 
`` Its feet are sharp like knives . '' 
`` More like razors , '' Kote said . 
His long fingers brushed the scrael 's black , featureless body . 
`` It 's smooth and hard , like pottery . '' 
`` Do n't go messing with it , '' the smith 's prentice said . 
Moving carefully , the innkeeper took one of the long , smooth legs and tried to break it with both hands like a stick . 
`` Not pottery , '' he amended . 
He set it against the edge of the table and leaned his weight against it . 
It broke with a sharp crack . 
`` More like stone . '' 
He looked up at Carter . 
`` How did it get all these cracks ? '' 
He pointed at the thin fractures that crazed the smooth black surface of the body . 
`` Nelly fell on it , '' Carter said . 
`` It jumped out of a tree and started to climb all over her , cutting her up with its feet . 
It moved so fast . 
I did n't even know what was going on . '' 
Carter finally sank into the chair at Graham 's urging . 
`` She got tangled in her harness and fell on it , broke some of its legs . 
Then it came after me , got on me , crawling all over . '' 
He crossed his arms in front of his bloody chest and shuddered . 
`` I managed to get it off me and stomped it hard as I could . 
Then it got on me again ... . '' 
He trailed off , his face ashen . 
The innkeeper nodded to himself as he continued to prod the thing . 
`` There 's no blood . 
No organs . 
It 's just grey inside . '' 
He poked it with a finger . 
`` Like a mushroom . '' 
`` Great Tehlu , just leave it alone , '' the smith 's prentice begged . 
`` Sometimes spiders twitch after you kill them . '' 
`` Listen to yourselves , '' Cob said scathingly . 
`` Spiders do n't get big as pigs . 
You know what this is . '' 
He looked around , making eye contact with each of them . 
`` It 's a demon . '' 
They looked at the broken thing . 
`` Oh , come on now , '' Jake said , disagreeing mostly out of habit . 
`` It 's not like ... '' He made an inarticulate gesture . 
`` It ca n't just ... '' Everyone knew what he was thinking . 
Certainly there were demons in the world . 
But they were like Tehlu 's angels.They were like heroes and kings . 
They belonged in stories . 
They belonged out there . 
Taborlin the Great called up fire and lightning to destroy demons . 
Tehlu broke them in his hands and sent them howling into the nameless void . 
Your childhood friend did n't stomp one to death on the road to Baedn-Bryt . 
It was ridiculous . 
Kote ran his hand through his red hair , then broke the silence . 
`` There 's one way to tell for sure , '' he said , reaching into his pocket . 
`` Iron or fire . '' 
He brought out a bulging leather purse . 
`` And the name of God , '' Graham pointed out . 
`` Demons fear three things : cold iron , clean fire , and the holy name of God . '' 
The innkeeper 's mouth pressed itself into a straight line that was not quite a frown . 
`` Of course , '' he said as he emptied his purse onto the table then fingered through the jumbled coins : heavy silver talents and thin silver bits , copper jots , broken ha ' pennies , and iron drabs . 
`` Does anyone have a shim ? '' 
`` Just use a drab , '' Jake said . 
`` That 's good iron . '' 
`` I do n't want good iron , '' the innkeeper said . 
`` A drab has too much carbon in it . 
It 's almost steel . '' 
`` He 's right , '' the smith 's prentice said . 
`` Except it 's not carbon . 
You use coke to make steel . 
Coke and lime . '' 
The innkeeper nodded deferentially to the boy . 
`` You 'd know best , young master . 
It 's your business after all . '' 
His long fingers finally found a shim in the pile of coins . 
He held it up . 
`` Here we are . '' 
`` What will it do ? '' 
Jake asked . 
`` Iron kills demons , '' Cob 's voice was uncertain , `` but this one 's already dead .
