0.129961191495146	429	|The Lady Patience is not the first woman to have to face her husband 's bastard . |	|Everyone here knows of his existence ; Verity 's clumsiness saw to that . |	|There 's no point to trying to hide him . |	2	Prince Verity	DEFAULT								
0.0927235533363	5	|Taker his name was , quite simply , and perhaps with that naming began the tradition that daughters and sons of his lineage would be given names that would shape their lives and beings . |	|Folk beliefs claim that such names were sealed to the newborn babes by magic , and that these royal offspring were incapable of betraying the virtues whose names they bore . |	|Passed through fire and plunged through salt water and offered to the winds of the air ; thus were names sealed to these chosen children . |	0

0.111052605658651	179	|The room smelled of food , of beer and men 's sweat , of wet wool garments and the smoke of the wood and drip of grease into flames . |	|Hogsheads and small casks ranged against the wall , and smoked joints of meats were dark shapes hung from the rafters . |	|The table bore a clutter of food and dishes . |	0

0.081830167668772	68	|No , memory shows me a man-at-arms , a warrior , gone a bit to gray and with a belly more of hard suet than muscle , but not some mannered house servant . |	|He looked both the old man and me up and down with a soldier 's practiced suspicion , and then stood there silently , waiting for us to state our business . |	|I think it rattled the old man a bit , and stimulated him , not to fear , but to anger . |	3	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT

0.558126764667983	80	|And he let go of me so suddenly that I sprawled to the stone doorstep at the guard 's feet . |	|I scrabbled to a sitting position , not much hurt that I recall , and looked up to see what would happen next between the two men . |	|The guard looked down at me , lips pursed slightly , not in judgment but merely considering how to classify me . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.813495489690263	172	|I went somewhat reluctantly , for the room was bright and pleasant and warm . |	|My cold feet had started to tingle , and I knew if I could stay a little longer , I would be warmed through . |	|But the guardsman 's hand was inexorable , and I was steered out of the warm chamber and back into the chill dimness of the dreary corridors . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.955543049566204	315	|Men came and went , eating and drinking , and regarding me with a speculative curiosity that I came to accept as normal . |	|The men had a sameness about them , with their rough wool cloaks and leggings , their hard bodies and easy movements , and the crest of a leaping buck that each bore over his heart . |	|My presence made some of them uncomfortable . |	0										
0.977524285393427	40	|It was as implacable as the icy gray rain that glazed the trampled snow and ice of the graveled pathway outside the huge wooden doors of the fortified building that stood like a fortress within the town itself . |	|The doors were tall , not just to a six-year-old boy , but tall enough to admit giants , to dwarf even the rangy old man who towered over me . |	|And they looked strange to me , although I can not summon up what type of door or dwelling would have looked familiar . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.819895023618805	141	|Yes . |	|That was the first year the Chyurda tried to close the pass . |	|Chivalry was up this way for three , four months , chivying them into opening it to us . |	1	Chyurda									
0.81131010518149	72	|I 've brought the boy to you , he said in a rusty voice . |	|And when the house guard continued to stare at him , without judgment or even curiosity , he elaborated . |	|I 've fed him at my table for six years , and never a word from his father , never a coin , never a visit , though my daughter gives me to understand he knows he fathered a bastard on her . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.753556366175406	226	|Burrich gripped my shoulders and turned me to the fire . |	|When he firmly took my jaw in his hand and lifted my face to his , he startled me , so that I dropped both bread and cheese . |	|Yet he paid no mind to this as he turned my face toward the fire and studied me as if I were a map . |	2	Burrich	DEFAULT								
0.591490510545081	167	|Jason , see the boy 's fed and bedded somewhere , at least for tonight . |	|I 'll give some thought to what 's to be done with him tomorrow . |	|Ca n't have royal bastards cluttering up the countryside . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.790038471457085	33	|One hopes it is not the case . |	|The remembrance is almost physical : the chill grayness of the fading day , the remorseless rain that soaked me , the icy cobbles of the strange town 's streets , even the callused roughness of the huge hand that gripped my small one . |	|Sometimes I wonder about that grip . |	0										
0.45480824494044	363	|I left it to you , and I do n't find fault with it . |	|It 's better than a lot of children have in this village , Eda knows . |	|For here , for now , it 's fine . |	1	Eda									
0.217126538207795	50	|The old man lifted the brass knocker and banged it down , once , twice , thrice on the plate that resounded to his pounding . |	|And then , from offstage , a voice sounded . |	|Not from within the doors , but from behind us , back the way we had come . |	0										
0.557553751655283	132	|he asked the guard . |	|Plowman says six . |	|The guard raised a hand to scratch at his cheek , then suddenly seemed to recall he was reporting . |	1	Plowman									
0.140381399274866	161	|I do not know if I was merely repeating what he and the guardsman had called me , or if I truly had no name besides the word . |	|For a moment the man looked surprised and a look of what might have been pity crossed his face . |	|But it disappeared as swiftly , leaving him looking only discomfited , or mildly annoyed . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.60397980752283	82	|The guard looked down at me , lips pursed slightly , not in judgment but merely considering how to classify me . |	|Whose get ? |	|he asked , and his tone was not one of curiosity , but only that of a man who asks for more specific information on a situation , in order to report well to a superior . |	0										
0.246980010038216	391	|Why should we tempt trouble ? |	|So say my mother and I . |	|But our father the King is not a hasty man , as well we know . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.419717716271468	268	|There were tall walls around us , and guards moved intermittently atop them , dark shadows visible only as they blotted the stars occasionally from the sky . |	|The cold bit at me , and I stumbled and slipped on the icy pathway . |	|But something about Burrich did not permit me to whimper or beg quarter from him . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.629297874518362	308	|I drifted into his mind and shared his dim dreams of an endless chase , pursuing a quarry I never saw , but whose hot scent dragged me onward through nettle , bramble , and scree . |	|And with the hound 's dream , the precision of the memory wavers like the bright colors and sharp edges of a drug dream . |	|Certainly the days that follow that first night have no such clarity in my mind . |	0										
0.577372930268126	79	|So you take him , and give him to his father . |	|And he let go of me so suddenly that I sprawled to the stone doorstep at the guard 's feet . |	|I scrabbled to a sitting position , not much hurt that I recall , and looked up to see what would happen next between the two men . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.769694880699941	119	|Heavy brows were raised above his dark eyes . |	|He had a barrel of a chest , and shoulders that strained the fabric of his shirt . |	|His fists were square and work-scarred , yet ink stained the fingers of his right hand . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.794003195836982	138	|The dark eyes roved over me , and the amusement in his smile grew broader . |	|So make it seven years or so , to allow for her belly to swell . |	|Damn . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.454427544550052	265	|The path cracked under my feet , and the wind seemed to find every crack and gap in my garments . |	|My feet and leggings had been warmed by the kitchen 's fire , but not quite dried , so the cold seized on them . |	|I remember darkness , and the sudden tiredness that came over me , a terrible weepy sleepiness that dragged at me as I followed the strange man with the bandaged leg through the chill , dark courtyard . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.19172328863674	328	|One other memory I have of that time , but it is not sharp-edged . |	|Rather it is warm and softly tinted , like a rich old tapestry seen in a dim room . |	|I recall being roused from sleep by the pup 's wriggling and the yellow light of a lantern being held over me . |	0										
0.457003596260684	15	|But each historical event I consider only awakens my own personal shades of loneliness and loss . |	|I fear I will have to set this work aside entirely , or else give in to reconsidering all that has shaped what I have become . |	|And so I begin again , and again , but always find that I am writing of my own beginnings rather than the beginnings of this land . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.927937209847186	320	|But those memories are blurry , and details , such as those of washing or changing garments , have probably faded with a six-year-olds calm assumptions of such things as normal . |	|Certainly I remember the hound pup , Nosy . |	|His coat was red and slick and short , and bristly in a way that prickled me through my clothes when we shared the horse blanket at night . |	2	DEFAULT	Nosy								
0.32866080434742	16	|I fear I will have to set this work aside entirely , or else give in to reconsidering all that has shaped what I have become . |	|And so I begin again , and again , but always find that I am writing of my own beginnings rather than the beginnings of this land . |	|I do not even know to whom I try to explain myself . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.589718380983668	314	|More often there was not , and I helped myself to whatever had been left out on the table , and shared generously with the pup that swiftly became my constant companion . |	|Men came and went , eating and drinking , and regarding me with a speculative curiosity that I came to accept as normal . |	|The men had a sameness about them , with their rough wool cloaks and leggings , their hard bodies and easy movements , and the crest of a leaping buck that each bore over his heart . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.300057479311351	283	|This 'll do . |	|For now , anyway . |	|I 'm jigged if I know what else to do with you . |	0										
0.619188338853322	146	|Who 'd have thought it of him ? |	|He paused , then : Who 's the mother ? |	|he demanded suddenly . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.213897593734891	22	|My memories reach back to when I was six years old . |	|Before that , there is nothing , only a blank gulf no exercise of my mind has ever been able to pierce . |	|Prior to that day at Moonseye , there is nothing . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.599171349697347	398	|Then he laughed . |	|Regal himself gave a short , bitter laugh . |	|I weary so of his humor . |	1	Regal									
0.493442134343095	248	|This statement seemed to put everyone , even Burrich , at a loss for words . |	|The silence lingered as I finished bread and cheese and meat , and washed it down with a swallow or two of beer that Burrich offered me . |	|The other men left the room gradually , in twos and threes , and still he sat there , drinking and looking at me . |	2	Burrich	DEFAULT								
0.883657788196381	55	|I ca n't recall that I saw anyone . |	|Certainly , I did not struggle to break free of the old man 's grip on my hand , nor did I call out , Mother , Mother . |	|Instead I stood , a spectator , and heard the sound of boots within the keep , and the unfastening of the door hasp within . |	3	DEFAULT	Mother	DEFAULT							
0.699733556711347	111	|The guard gave me a gentle nudge on the shoulder that propelled me a foot or so closer to the man . |	|An old plowman left him , Prince Verity , sir . |	|Says it 's Prince Chivalry 's bastid , sir . |	3	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	Prince Verity							
0.888473217847384	28	|Perhaps I have heard the story so many times , from so many sources , that I now recall it as an actual memory of my own . |	|Is the detail the result of a six-year-old 's open absorption of all that goes on around him ? |	|Or could the completeness of the memory be the bright overlay of the Skill , and the later drugs a man takes to control his addiction to it , the drugs that bring on pains and cravings of their own ? |	0										
0.833008730024845	347	|But the younger man with him gleamed in scarlets and primrose , and his cloak drooped with twice the width of cloth needed to cover a man . |	|The doublet that showed beneath it was a rich cream , and laden with lace . |	|The scarf at his throat was secured with a leaping stag done in gold , its single eye a winking green gem . |	0										
0.421286743144062	400	|I weary so of his humor . |	|Oh , said Verity again , and I lay still and wondered if he were trying to sort out the King 's words , or refraining from replying to his brother 's complaint . |	|You discern his real reasons , of course , Regal informed him . |	3	Prince Verity	Regal	DEFAULT							
0.454379063347839	102	|This room was as warm as the corridor had been chill , and alive as the other chambers had been deserted . |	|I recall a quantity of furniture in it , rugs and hangings , and shelves of tablets and scrolls overlaid with the scattering of clutter that any well-used and comfortable chamber takes on . |	|There was a fire burning in a massive fireplace , filling the room with heat and a pleasantly resinous scent . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.592308967652955	407	|Despite his foolish marriage and his eccentric wife . |	|Despite this mess . |	|And now he thinks this will sway the people , make them warmer toward him . |	0										
0.513072065300949	279	|Horses stirred as we passed their stalls . |	|Hawks are down at the far end , Burrich said as we passed stall after stall . |	|I accepted it as something he thought I should know . |	1	Burrich									
0.996863673834396	145	|Damn . |	|Who 'd have thought it of him ? |	|He paused , then : Who 's the mother ? |	1	DEFAULT									
0.274727409833847	115	|Then something very like an amused smile lightened his features and he rose and came around the desk to stand with his fists on his hips , looking down on me . |	|I did not feel threatened by his scrutiny ; rather it was as if something about my appearance pleased him inordinately . |	|I looked up at him curiously . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.547362050204801	300	|But for tonight , you 'll be warm here , and safe . |	|He stood a moment longer , looking down at us . |	|Horse , hound , and hawk , Chivalry . |	1	Chiv									
0.873360065090458	176	|Perhaps I whimpered , or perhaps he grew tired of my slower pace , for he spun suddenly , seized me , and tossed me up to sit on his shoulder as casually as if I weighed nothing at all . |	|Soggy little pup , you , he observed , without rancor , and then bore me down corridors and around turns and up and down steps and finally into the yellow light and space of a large kitchen . |	|There , half a dozen other guards lounged on benches and ate and drank at a big scarred table before a fire fully twice as large as the one in the study had been . |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
0.54712264976611	134	|The guard raised a hand to scratch at his cheek , then suddenly seemed to recall he was reporting . |	|He dropped his hand . |	|Sir , he added . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.680406839741021	368	|Then our father wishes him to return with us to Buckkeep ? |	|The question came from Verity . |	|Our father does . |	1	Prince Verity									
0.055984456248126	181	|The table bore a clutter of food and dishes . |	|A chunk of meat on a spit was swung back from the flames and dripping fat onto the stone hearth . |	|My stomach clutched suddenly at my ribs at the rich smell . |	0										
0.013566992210575	214	|An unusual quiet bloomed suddenly in the kitchen . |	|Men paused in their eating , gripping bread or mugs or trenchers , and turned eyes to the man called Burrich . |	|He himself set his mug carefully away from the edge of the table . |	1	Burrich									
0.647047530550283	379	|We scarcely need more confusion in the line of succession . |	|I see no confusion in it now , Regal . |	|Verity spoke evenly . |	2	Regal	Prince Verity								
0.878540081972674	54	|I turned to look at her , but it had begun to snow again , a lacy veil that clung to eyelashes and coat sleeves . |	|I ca n't recall that I saw anyone . |	|Certainly , I did not struggle to break free of the old man 's grip on my hand , nor did I call out , Mother , Mother . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.47618461339305	416	|I heard the sourness in Regal 's voice . |	|So the King seems to think . |	|Does he care nothing for the disgrace ? |	1	DEFAULT									
0.507717870590302	366	|It will have to be different when he comes back to Buckkeep . |	|Regal did not sound pleased . |	|Then our father wishes him to return with us to Buckkeep ? |	1	Regal									
0.078733491561648	331	|Two men bent over me , but Burrich stood stiffly behind them and I was not afraid . |	|Now you 've wakened him , warned the one , and he was Prince Verity , the man from the warmly lit chamber of my first evening . |	|So ? |	3	DEFAULT	Burrich	Prince Verity							
0.817768479253619	58	|One last time she called . |	|I can still hear the words perfectly , the desperation in a voice that now would sound young to my ears . |	|Father , please , I beg you ! |	1	DEFAULT									
0.910137467040417	342	|This man was younger by far . |	|His cheeks were beardless , and his scented and smoothed hair was finer and brown . |	|His cheeks and forehead had been stung to redness by the night 's chill , but it was a new thing , not Verity 's weathered ruddiness . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.778750972375223	457	|Prince Verity became King-in-Waiting and Prince Regal moved up a notch in the line of succession . |	|If all I had ever done was to be born and discovered , I would have left a mark across all the land for all time . |	|I grew up fatherless and motherless in a court where all recognized me as a catalyst . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.072398603449678	4	|And of the first real King , little more than his name and some extravagant legends remain . |	|Taker his name was , quite simply , and perhaps with that naming began the tradition that daughters and sons of his lineage would be given names that would shape their lives and beings . |	|Folk beliefs claim that such names were sealed to the newborn babes by magic , and that these royal offspring were incapable of betraying the virtues whose names they bore . |	1	DEFAULT

0.30256869850624	412	|Regal 's tone betrayed that he agreed with none of this . |	|And this will make the people like him more , support his future kingship more ? |	|That he fathered a child on some wild woman before he married his queen ? |	1	DEFAULT

0.627284975765795	418	|Does he care nothing for the disgrace ? |	|But I suspect Chivalry will feel differently about using his bastard in such a way . |	|Especially as it regards dear Patience . |	3	Chiv	Patience	DEFAULT

0.565797418072435	318	|I grew accustomed to the mutter of voices that began whenever I left the kitchen . |	|Burrich was a constant in those days , giving me the same care he gave to Chivalry 's beasts ; I was fed , watered , groomed , and exercised , said exercise usually coming in the form of trotting at his heels as he performed his other duties . |	|But those memories are blurry , and details , such as those of washing or changing garments , have probably faded with a six-year-olds calm assumptions of such things as normal . |	3	DEFAULT	Burrich	Chiv

0.866342418306888	244	|Even so , even so , the guard agreed abruptly , and Jason nodded like a courting bird in agreement . |	|Young as I was , I still wondered what kind of man this was who , with one leg bandaged , could quell a room full of rough men with a look or a word . |	|Boy do n't have a name , Jason volunteered into the silence . |	1	DEFAULT
