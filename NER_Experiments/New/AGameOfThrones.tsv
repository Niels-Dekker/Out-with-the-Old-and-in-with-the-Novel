|They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded , twenty in all , and Bran rode among them , nervous with excitement . |	Bran Stark									
|This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king 's justice done . |	Bran Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|It was the ninth year of summer , and the seventh of Bran 's life . |	Bran Stark									
|The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills . |	Default									
|Robb thought he was a wildling , his sword sworn to Mance Rayder , the King-beyond-the-Wall . |	Robb Stark	Mance Rayder								
|It made Bran 's skin prickle to think of it . |	Bran Stark									
|He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them . |	Old Nan	Bran Stark								
|The wildlings were cruel men , she said , slavers and slayers and thieves . |	Old Nan									
|They consorted with giants and ghouls , stole girl children in the dead of night , and drank blood from polished horns . |										
|And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children . |										
|But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king 's justice was old and scrawny , not much taller than Robb . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite , and he dressed all in black , the same as a brother of the Night 's Watch , except that his furs were ragged and greasy . |	Default									
|The breath of man and horse mingled , steaming , in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them . |	lord Eddard Stark	Default								
|Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses , with Bran between them on his pony , trying to seem older than seven , trying to pretend that he 'd seen all this before . |	Robb Stark	Jon Snow	Bran Stark							
|A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate . |										
|Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell : a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field . |										
|Bran 's father sat solemnly on his horse , long brown hair stirring in the wind . |	Bran Stark									
|His closely trimmed beard was shot with white , making him look older than his thirty-five years . |	Default									
|He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day , and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest . |	Lord Eddard Stark									
|He had taken off Father 's face , Bran thought , and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell . |	Bran Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning , but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said . |	Bran Stark									
|Finally his lord father gave a command , and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square . |	Bran Stark	Lord Eddard Stark	Default							
|They forced his head down onto the hard black wood . |	Default									
|Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword . |	Lord Eddard Stark	Theon Greyjoy								
|`` Ice , '' that sword was called . |										
|It was as wide across as a man 's hand , and taller even than Robb . |	Robb Stark									
|The blade was Valyrian steel , spell-forged and dark as smoke . |										
|Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel . |										
|His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel , the captain of his household guard . |	Lord Eddard Stark	Jory Cassel								
|He took hold of Ice with both hands and said , `` In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon , the First of his Name , King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm , by the word of Eddard of the House Stark , Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North , I do sentence you to die . '' |	lord Eddard Stark	Robert Baratheon	Default							
|He lifted the greatsword high above his head . |	Lord Eddard Stark									
|Bran 's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer . |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|`` Keep the pony well in hand , '' he whispered . |	Jon Snow									
|`` And do n't look away . |										
|Father will know if you do . '' |	Bran Stark	Default								
|Bran kept his pony well in hand , and did not look away . |	Bran Stark									
|His father took off the man 's head with a single sure stroke . |	Bran Stark	Default	Default							
|Blood sprayed out across the snow , as red as surnmerwine . |										
|One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting . |										
|Bran could not take his eyes off the blood . |	Bran Stark									
|The snows around the stump drank it eagerly , reddening as he watched . |										
|The head bounced off a thick root and rolled . |										
|It came up near Greyjoy 's feet . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|Theon was a lean , dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|He laughed , put his boot on the head , and kicked it away . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|`` Ass , '' Jon muttered , low enough so Greyjoy did not hear . |	Jon Snow	Theon Greyjoy								
|He put a hand on Bran 's shoulder , and Bran looked over at his bastard brother . |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|`` You did well , '' Jon told him solemnly . |	Jon Snow	Bran Stark								
|Jon was fourteen , an old hand at justice . |	Jon Snow									
|It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell , though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky . |										
|Bran rode with his brothers , well ahead of the main party , his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses . |	Bran Stark									
|`` The deserter died bravely , '' Robb said . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|He was big and broad and growing every day , with his mother 's coloring , the fair skin , red-brown hair , and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|`` He had courage , at the least . '' |	Default									
|`` No , '' Jon Snow said quietly . |	Jon Snow									
|`` It was not courage . |										
|This one was dead of fear . |										
|You could see it in his eyes , Stark . '' |	Jon Snow									
|Jon 's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black , but there was little they did not see . |	Jon Snow									
|He was of an age with Robb , but they did not look alike . |	Jon Snow	Robb Stark								
|Jon was slender where Robb was muscular , dark where Robb was fair , graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast . |	Jon Snow	Robb Stark								
|Robb was not impressed . |	Robb Stark									
|`` The Others take his eyes , '' he swore . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|`` He died well . |	Default									
|Race you to the bridge ? '' |	Jon Snow									
|`` Done , '' Jon said , kicking his horse forward . |	Jon Snow									
|Robb cursed and followed , and they galloped off down the trail , Robb laughing and hooting , Jon silent and intent . |	Robb Stark	Jon Snow								
|The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went . |										
|Bran did not try to follow . |	Bran Stark									
|His pony could not keep up . |	Bran Stark									
|He had seen the ragged man 's eyes , and he was thinking of them now . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|After a while , the sound of Robb 's laughter receded , and the woods grew silent again . |	Robb Stark									
|So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|`` Are you well , Bran ? '' |	Bran Stark									
|he asked , not unkindly . |	Default									
|`` Yes , Father , '' Bran told him . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|He looked up . |	Bran Stark									
|Wrapped in his furs and leathers , mounted on his great warhorse , his lord father loomed over him like a giant . |	Bran Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|`` Robb says the man died bravely , but Jon says he was afraid . '' |	Robb Stark	Jon Snow	Default							
|`` What do you think ? '' |	Default									
|his father asked . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|Bran thought about it . |	Bran Stark									
|`` Can a man still be brave if he 's afraid ? '' |										
|`` That is the only time a man can be brave , '' his father told him . |	Default	Default								
|`` Do you understand why I did it ? '' |	Bran Stark	Default								
|`` He was a wildling , '' Bran said . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|`` They carry off women and sell them to the Others . '' |	Default									
|His lord father smiled . |	Bran Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|`` Old Nan has been telling you stories again . |	Old Nan	Default								
|In truth , the man was an oathbreaker , a deserter from the Night 's Watch . |	Default									
|No man is more dangerous . |										
|The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken , so he will not flinch from any crime , no matter how vile . |	Default									
|But you mistake me . |	Default	Default								
|The question was not why the man had to die , but why I must do it . '' |	Default	Default								
|Bran had no answer for that . |	Bran Stark									
|`` King Robert has a headsman , '' he said , uncertainly . |	Robert Baratheon	Bran Stark								
|`` He does , '' his father admitted . |	Robert Baratheon	Default								
|`` As did the Targaryen kings before him . |	Default									
|Yet our way is the older way . |										
|The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks , and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . |										
|If you would take a man 's life , you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words . |	Default	Default								
|And if you can not bear to do that , then perhaps the man does not deserve to die . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|`` One day , Bran , you will be Robb 's bannerman , holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king , and justice will fall to you . |	Bran Stark	Robb Stark								
|When that day comes , you must take no pleasure in the task , but neither must you look away . |	Bran Stark									
|A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is . '' |										
|That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them . |	Jon Snow									
|He waved and shouted down at them . |	Jon Snow									
|`` Father , Bran , come quickly , see what Robb has found ! '' |	Bran Stark	Robb Stark	Default							
|Then he was gone again . |	Default									
|Jory rode up beside them . |	Jory Cassel									
|`` Trouble , my lord ? '' |	Lord Eddard Stark									
|`` Beyond a doubt , '' his lord father said . |	Lord Eddard Stark	Default								
|`` Come , let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now . '' |										
|He sent his horse into a trot . |	Default									
|Jory and Bran and the rest came after . |	Jory Cassel	Bran Stark								
|They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge , with Jon still mounted beside him . |	Jon Snow	Robb Stark								
|The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn . |										
|Robb stood knee-deep in white , his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair . |	Robb Stark									
|He was cradling something in his arm , while the boys talked in hushed , excited voices . |	Robb Stark									
|The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts , groping for solid footing on the hidden , uneven ground . |										
|Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys . |	Jory Cassel	Theon Greyjoy								
|Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|Bran heard the breath go out of him . |	Bran Stark	Theon Greyjoy								
|`` Gods ! '' |										
|he exclaimed , struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword . |	Default									
|Jory 's sword was already out . |	Jory Cassel									
|`` Robb , get away from it ! '' |	Robb Stark									
|he called as his horse reared under him . |	Default									
|Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms . |	Robb Stark									
|`` She ca n't hurt you , '' he said . |	Robb Stark	Jory Cassel								
|`` She 's dead , Jory . '' |	Jory Cassel	Default								
|Bran was afire with curiosity by then . |	Bran Stark									
|He would have spurred the pony faster , but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|Bran jumped off and ran . |	Bran Stark									
|By then Jon , Jory , and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well . |	Jon Snow	Jory Cassel	Theon Greyjoy							
|`` What in the seven hells is it ? '' |										
|Greyjoy was saying . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|`` A wolf , '' Robb told him . |	Robb Stark	Theon Greyjoy								
|`` A freak , '' Greyjoy said . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|`` Look at the size of it . '' |										
|Bran 's heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers ' side . |	Bran Stark									
|Half-buried in bloodstained snow , a huge dark shape slumped in death . |										
|Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur , and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman 's perfume . |										
|Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots , a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth . |										
|But it was the size of it that made him gasp . |	Bran Stark									
|It was bigger than his pony , twice the size of the largest hound in his father 's kennel . |	Default	Default								
|`` It 's no freak , '' Jon said calmly . |	Jon Snow									
|`` That 's a direwolf . |										
|They grow larger than the other kind . '' |										
|Theon Greyjoy said , `` There 's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years . '' |	Theon Greyjoy									
|`` I see one now , '' Jon replied . |	Jon Snow									
|Bran tore his eyes away from the monster . |	Bran Stark									
|That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb 's arms . |	Bran Stark	Robb Stark								
|He gave a cry of delight and moved closer . |	Default									
|The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur , its eyes still closed . |										
|It nuzzled blindly against Robb 's chest as he cradled it , searching for milk among his leathers , making a sad little whimpery sound . |	Robb Stark									
|Bran reached out hesitantly . |	Bran Stark									
|`` Go on , '' Robb told him . |	Robb Stark	Bran Stark								
|`` You can touch him . '' |	Bran Stark	Robb Stark								
|Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke , then turned as Jon said , `` Here you go . '' |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|His half brother put a second pup into his arms . |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|`` There are five of them . '' |										
|Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face . |	Bran Stark									
|Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek . |	Bran Stark									
|`` Direwolves loose in the realm , after so many years , '' muttered Hullen , the master of horse . |	Hullen									
|`` I like it not . '' |	Jory Cassel									
|`` It is a sign , '' Jory said . |	Jory Cassel									
|Father frowned . |	Default									
|`` This is only a dead animal , Jory , '' he said . |	Jory Cassel	Default								
|Yet he seemed troubled . |	Default									
|Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body . |	Default									
|`` Do we know what killed her ? '' |	Default									
|`` There 's something in the throat , '' Robb told him , proud to have found the answer before his father even asked . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|`` There , just under the jaw . '' |										
|His father knelt and groped under the beast 's head with his hand . |	Default									
|He gave a yank and held it up for all to see . |	Default									
|A foot of shattered antler , tines snapped off , all wet with blood . |										
|A sudden silence descended over the party . |										
|The men looked at the antler uneasily , and no one dared to speak . |										
|Even Bran could sense their fear , though he did not understand . |	Bran Stark									
|His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|`` I 'm surprised she lived long enough to whelp , '' he said . |	Default									
|His voice broke the spell . |	Jory Cassel									
|`` Maybe she did n't , '' Jory said . |	Jory Cassel	Default								
|`` I 've heard tales ... maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came . '' |	Jory Cassel	Default								
|`` Born with the dead , '' another man put in . |	Default									
|`` Worse luck . '' |										
|`` No matter , '' said Hullen . |	Hullen									
|`` They be dead soon enough too . '' |										
|Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay . |	Bran Stark									
|`` The sooner the better , '' Theon Greyjoy agreed . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|He drew his sword . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|`` Give the beast here , Bran . '' |	Bran Stark									
|The little thing squirmed against him , as if it heard and understood . |	Bran Stark									
|`` No ! '' |										
|Bran cried out fiercely . |	Bran Stark									
|`` It 's mine . '' |										
|`` Put away your sword , Greyjoy , '' Robb said . |	Robb Stark	Theon Greyjoy								
|For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father , like the lord he would someday be . |	Robb Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|`` We will keep these pups . '' |										
|`` You can not do that , boy , '' said Harwin , who was Hullen 's son . |	Default	Harwin	Hullen							
|`` It be a mercy to kill them , '' Hullen said . |	Hullen									
|Bran looked to his lord father for rescue , but got only a frown , a furrowed brow . |	Bran Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|`` Hullen speaks truly , son . |	Bran Stark	Hullen								
|Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation . '' |										
|`` No ! '' |										
|He could feel tears welling in his eyes , and he looked away . |	Default									
|He did not want to cry in front of his father . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|Robb resisted stubbornly . |	Robb Stark									
|`` Ser Rodrik 's red bitch whelped again last week , '' he said . |	Ser Rodrik Cassel	Robb Stark								
|`` It was a small litter , only two live pups . |										
|She 'll have milk enough . '' |										
|`` She 'll rip them apart when they try to nurse . '' |	Default									
|`` Lord Stark , '' Jon said . |	Jon Snow	Lord Eddard Stark								
|It was strange to hear him call Father that , so formal . |	Jon Snow	Lord Eddard Stark								
|Bran looked at him with desperate hope . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|`` There are five pups , '' he told Father . |	Default									
|`` Three male , two female . '' |										
|`` What of it , Jon ? '' |	Jon Snow									
|`` You have five trueborn children , '' Jon said . |	Jon Snow	Default								
|`` Three sons , two daughters . |										
|The direwolf is the sigil of your House . |	Default									
|Your children were meant to have these pups , my lord . '' |	Lord Eddard Stark									
|Bran saw his father 's face change , saw the other men exchange glances . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment . |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|Even at seven , Bran understood what his brother had done . |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself . |	Jon Snow									
|He had included the girls , included even Rickon , the baby , but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow , the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own . |	Jon Snow	Rickon Stark								
|Their father understood as well . |	Default									
|`` You want no pup for yourself , Jon ? '' |	Jon Snow									
|he asked softly . |	Default									
|`` The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark , '' Jon pointed out . |	Jon Snow									
|`` I am no Stark , Father . '' |	Jon Snow	Lord Eddard Stark								
|Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully . |	Jon Snow	Lord Eddard Stark								
|Robb rushed into the silence he left . |	Robb Stark	Lord Eddard Stark								
|`` I will nurse him myself , Father , '' he promised . |	Robb Stark	Default								
|`` I will soak a towel with warm milk , and give him suck from that . '' |	Default	Default								
|`` Me too ! '' |	Bran Stark									
|Bran echoed . |	Bran Stark									
|The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes . |	lord Eddard Stark									
|`` Easy to say , and harder to do . |										
|I will not have you wasting the servants ' time with this . |	Default	Default								
|If you want these pups , you will feed them yourselves . |	Default									
|Is that understood ? '' |										
|Bran nodded eagerly . |	Bran Stark									
|The pup squirmed in his grasp , licked at his face with a warm tongue . |	Bran Stark									
|`` You must train them as well , '' their father said . |	Default	Default								
|`` You must train them . |	Default									
|The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters , I promise you that . |	Default	Default	Default							
|And the gods help you if you neglect them , or brutalize them , or train them badly . |	Default									
|These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick . |										
|A direwolf will rip a man 's arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat . |										
|Are you sure you want this ? '' |	Bran Stark									
|`` Yes , Father , '' Bran said . |	Bran Stark									
|`` Yes , '' Robb agreed . |	Robb Stark									
|`` The pups may die anyway , despite all you do . '' |	Robb Stark									
|`` They wo n't die , '' Robb said . |	Robb Stark									
|`` We wo n't let them die . '' |										
|`` Keep them , then . |										
|Jory , Desmond , gather up the other pups . |	Jory Cassel	Desmond								
|It 's time we were back to Winterfell . '' |										
|It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory . |	Bran Stark									
|By then , his pup was snuggled inside his leathers , warm against him , safe for the long ride home . |	Bran Stark									
|Bran was wondering what to name him . |	Bran Stark	Default								
|Halfway across the bridge , Jon pulled up suddenly . |	Jon Snow									
|`` What is it , Jon ? '' |	Jon Snow									
|their lord father asked . |	Lord Eddard Stark									
|`` Ca n't you hear it ? '' |	Bran Stark									
|Bran could hear the wind in the trees , the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks , the whimpering of his hungry pup , but Jon was listening to something else . |	Bran Stark	Jon Snow								
|`` There , '' Jon said . |	Jon Snow									
|He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge . |	Jon Snow									
|They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow , watched him kneel . |	Default									
|A moment later he was riding back to them , smiling . |	Jon Snow									
|`` He must have crawled away from the others , '' Jon said . |	Jon Snow	Default								
|`` Or been driven away , '' their father said , looking at the sixth pup . |	Default									
|His fur was white , where the rest of the litter was grey . |	Default									
|His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning . |	Default	Default								
|Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind . |	Bran Stark									
|`` An albino , '' Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement . |	Theon Greyjoy									
|`` This one will die even faster than the others . '' |	Default									
|Jon Snow gave his father 's ward a long , chilling look . |	Jon Snow	Theon Greyjoy								
|`` I think not , Greyjoy , '' he said . |	Jon Snow	Theon Greyjoy
