|Homer The Survivors The lapping of water in his ears . |	DEFAULT									
|That was the first thing . |										
|The lapping of water , the rustling of trees , the odd click and twitter of a bird . |										
|Logen opened his eyes a crack . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Light , blurry bright through leaves . |										
|This was death ? |										
|Then why did it hurt so much ? |										
|His whole left side was throbbing . |	DEFAULT									
|He tried to take a proper breath , choked , coughed up water , spat out mud . |	DEFAULT									
|He groaned , flopped over onto his hands and knees , dragged himself up out of the river , gasping through clenched teeth , rolled onto his back in the moss and slime and rotten sticks at the water 's edge . |	DEFAULT									
|He lay there for a moment , staring up at the grey sky beyond the black branches , breath wheezing in his raw throat . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I am still alive , '' he croaked to himself . |	DEFAULT									
|Still alive , in spite of the best efforts of nature , Shanka , men and beasts . |										
|Soaking wet and flat on his back , he started to chuckle . |	DEFAULT									
|Reedy , gurgling laughter . |										
|Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers , say he 's a survivor . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|A cold wind blew across the rotting river bank , and Logen 's laughter slowly died . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Alive he might be , but staying alive , that was another question . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|He sat up , wincing at the pain . |	DEFAULT									
|He tottered to his feet , leaning against the nearest tree trunk . |	DEFAULT									
|He scraped the dirt out of his nose , his eyes , his ears . |	DEFAULT									
|He pulled up his wet shirt to take a look at the damage . |	DEFAULT									
|His side was covered in bruises from the fall . |	DEFAULT									
|Blue and purple stains all up his ribs . |	DEFAULT									
|Tender to the touch , and no mistake , but it did n't feel like anything was broken . |										
|His leg was a mess . |	DEFAULT									
|Torn and bloody from the Shanka 's teeth . |										
|It hurt bad , but his foot still moved well enough , and that was the main thing . |	DEFAULT									
|He 'd need his foot , if he was going to get out of this . |	DEFAULT									
|He still had his knife in the sheath at his belt , and he was mightily glad to see it . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|You could never have too many knives in Logen 's experience , and this was a good one , but the outlook was still bleak . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|He was on his own , in woods crawling with Flatheads . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|He had no idea where he was , but he could follow the river . |	DEFAULT									
|The rivers all flowed north , from the mountains to the cold sea . |										
|Follow the river southwards , against the current . |										
|Follow the river and climb up , into the High Places where the Shanka could n't find him . |	DEFAULT									
|That was his only chance . |	DEFAULT									
|It would be cold up there , this time of year . |										
|Deadly cold . |										
|He looked down at his bare feet . |	DEFAULT									
|It was just his luck that the Shanka had come while he had his boots off , trimming his blisters . |	DEFAULT									
|No coat either -- he 'd been sitting near the fire . |	DEFAULT									
|Like this , he would n't last a day in the mountains . |	DEFAULT									
|His hands and feet would turn black in the night , and he 'd die bit by bit before he even reached the passes . |	DEFAULT									
|If he did n't starve first . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Shit , '' he muttered . |	DEFAULT									
|He had to go back to the camp . |	DEFAULT									
|He had to hope the Flatheads had moved on , hope they 'd left something behind . |	DEFAULT									
|Something he could use to survive . |	DEFAULT									
|That was an awful lot of hoping , but he had no choice . |	DEFAULT									
|He never had any choices . |	DEFAULT									
|It had started to rain by the time Logen found the place . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Spitting drops that plastered his hair to his skull , kept his clothes wet through . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|He pressed himself against a mossy trunk and peered out towards the camp , heart pounding , fingers of his right hand curled painful tight around the slippery grip of his knife . |	DEFAULT									
|He saw the blackened circle where the fire had been , half-burned sticks and ash trampled round it . |	DEFAULT									
|He saw the big log Threetrees and Dow had been sitting on when the Flatheads came . |	DEFAULT	Dow	Threetrees							
|He saw odd bits of torn and broken gear scattered across the clearing . |	DEFAULT									
|He counted three dead Shanka crumpled on the ground , one with an arrow poking out of its chest . |	DEFAULT									
|Three dead ones , but no sign of any alive . |										
|That was lucky . |										
|Just lucky enough to survive , as always . |										
|Still , they might be back at any moment . |										
|He had to be quick . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Logen scuttled out from the trees , casting about on the ground . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|His boots were still there where he 'd left them . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|He snatched them up and dragged them on to his freezing feet , hopping around , almost slipping in his haste . |	DEFAULT									
|His coat was there too , wedged under the log , battered and scarred from ten years of weather and war , torn and stitched back together , missing half a sleeve . |	DEFAULT									
|His pack was lying shapeless in the brush nearby , its contents strewn out down the slope . |										
|He crouched , breathless , throwing it all back inside . |	DEFAULT									
|A length of rope , his old clay pipe , some strips of dried meat , needle and twine , a dented flask with some liquor still sloshing inside . |	DEFAULT									
|All good . |										
|All useful . |										
|There was a tattered blanket snagged on a branch , wet and half caked in grime . |										
|Logen pulled it up , and grinned . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|His old , battered cook pot was underneath . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Lying on its side , kicked off the fire in the fight maybe . |										
|He grabbed hold of it with both hands . |	DEFAULT									
|It felt safe , familiar , dented and blackened from years of hard use . |										
|He 'd had that pot a long time . |	DEFAULT									
|It had followed him all through the wars , across the North and back again . |	DEFAULT									
|They had all cooked in it together , out on the trail , all eaten out of it . |										
|Forley , Grim , the Dogman , all of them . |	Forley	Grim	Dogman							
|Logen looked over the campsite again . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Three dead Shanka , but none of his people . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Maybe they were still out there . |										
|Maybe if he took a risk , tried to look -- `` No . '' |	DEFAULT									
|He said it quietly , under his breath . |	DEFAULT									
|He knew better than that . |	DEFAULT									
|There had been a lot of Flatheads . |										
|An awful lot . |										
|He had no idea how long he 'd lain on the river bank . |	DEFAULT									
|Even if a couple of the boys had got away , the Shanka would be hunting them , hunting them down in the forests . |										
|They were nothing but corpses now , for sure , scattered across the high valleys . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|All Logen could do was make for the mountains , and try to save his own sorry life . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|You have to be realistic . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Have to be , however much it hurts . |										
|`` It 's just you and me now , '' said Logen as he stuffed the pot into his pack and threw it over his shoulder . |	Logen Ninefingers	DEFAULT								
|He started to limp off , as fast as he could . |	Logen Ninefingers									
|Uphill , towards the river , towards the mountains . |										
|Just the two of them . |										
|Him and the pot . |	DEFAULT									
|They were the only survivors . |
