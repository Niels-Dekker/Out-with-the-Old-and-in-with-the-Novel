|Arlen paused in his work , looking up at the lavender wash of the dawn sky . |	Arlen									
|Mist still clung to the air , bringing with it a damp , acrid taste that was all too familiar . |										
|A quiet dread built in his gut as he waited in the morning stillness , hoping that it had been his imagination . |	DEFAULT									
|He was eleven years old . |	DEFAULT									
|There was a pause , and then the horn blew twice in rapid succession . |										
|One long and two short meant south and east . |										
|The Cluster by the Woods . |										
|His father had friends among the cutters . |	Arlen									
|Behind Arlen , the door to the house opened , and he knew his mother would be there , covering her mouth with both hands . |	Arlen	DEFAULT								
|Arlen returned to his work , not needing to be told to hurry . |	Arlen									
|Some chores could wait a day , but the stock still needed to be fed and the cows milked . |										
|He left the animals in the barns and opened the hay stores , slopped the pigs , and ran to fetch a wooden milk bucket . |	DEFAULT									
|His mother was already squatting beneath the first of the cows . |	DEFAULT									
|He snatched the spare stool and they found cadence in their work , the sound of milk striking wood drumming a funeral march . |	Arlen									
|As they moved to the next pair down the line , Arlen saw his father begin hitching their strongest horse , a five-year-old chestnut-colored mare named Missy , to the cart . |	Arlen	Missy								
|His face was grim as he worked . |	DEFAULT									
|What would they find this time ? |										
|Before long , they were in the cart , trundling toward the small cluster of houses by the woods . |										
|It was dangerous there , over an hour 's run to the nearest warded structure , but the lumber was needed . |										
|Arlen 's mother , wrapped in her worn shawl , held him tightly as they rode . |	Arlen	Mam								
|`` I 'm a big boy , Mam , '' Arlen complained . |	Mam	Arlen								
|`` I do n't need you to hold me like a baby . |	Arlen	Mam								
|I 'm not scared . '' |	DEFAULT									
|It was n't entirely true , but it would not do for the other children to see him clinging to his mother as they rode in . |	DEFAULT									
|They made mock of him enough as it was . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I 'm scared , '' his mother said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` What if it 's me who needs to be held ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Feeling suddenly proud , Arlen pulled close to his mother again as they traveled down the road . |	Arlen									
|She could never fool him , but she always knew what to say just the same . |	DEFAULT	Arlen								
|A pillar of greasy smoke told them more than they wanted to know long before they reached their destination . |										
|They were burning the dead . |										
|And starting the fires this early , without waiting for others to arrive and pray , meant there were a great many . |										
|Too many to pray over each one , if the work was to be complete before dusk . |										
|It was more than five miles from Arlen 's father 's farm to the Cluster by the Woods . |	Arlen									
|By the time they arrived , the few remaining cabin fires had been put out , though in truth there was little left to burn . |										
|Fifteen houses , all reduced to rubble and ash . |										
|`` The woodpiles , too , '' Arlen 's father said , spitting over the side of the cart . |	Arlen									
|He gestured with his chin toward the blackened ruin that remained of a season 's cutting . |	DEFAULT									
|Arlen grimaced at the thought of how the rickety fence that penned the animals would have to last another year , and immediately felt guilty . |	Arlen									
|It was only wood , after all . |										
|The town Speaker approached their cart as it pulled up . |										
|Selia , whom Arlen 's mother sometimes called Selia the Barren , was a hard woman , tall and thin , with skin like tough leather . |	Selia	Arlen								
|Her long gray hair was pulled into a tight bun , and she wore her shawl like a badge of office . |	Selia									
|She brooked no nonsense , as Arlen had learned more than once at the end of her stick , but today he was comforted by her presence . |	Selia	Arlen								
|Like Arlen 's father , something about Selia made him feel safe . |	Arlen	Selia								
|Though she had never had children of her own , Selia acted as a parent to everyone in Tibbet 's Brook . |	Selia									
|Few could match her wisdom , and fewer still her stubbornness . |	Selia									
|When you were on Selia 's good side , it felt like the safest place in the world . |	Selia									
|`` It 's good that you 've come , Jeph , '' Selia told Arlen 's father . |	Jeph	Selia	Arlen							
|`` Silvy and young Arlen , too , '' she said , nodding to them . |	Silvy	Arlen	Selia							
|`` We need every hand we can get . |										
|Even the boy can help . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Arlen 's father grunted , stepping down from the cart . |	Arlen									
|`` I brought my tools , '' he said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Just tell me where we can throw in . '' |	Arlen									
|Arlen collected the precious tools from the back of their cart . |	Arlen									
|Metal was scarce in the Brook , and his father was proud of his two shovels , his pick , and his saw . |	Arlen									
|They would all see heavy use this day . |										
|`` How many lost ? '' |										
|Jeph asked , though he did n't really seem to want to know . |	Jeph									
|`` Twenty-seven , '' Selia said . |	Selia									
|Silvy choked and covered her mouth , tears welling in her eyes . |	Silvy									
|Jeph spat again . |	Jeph									
|`` Any survivors ? '' |										
|he asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` A few , '' Selia said . |	Selia									
|`` Manie '' -- she pointed with her stick at a boy who stood staring at the funeral pyre -- `` ran all the way to my house in the dark . '' |	Manie	Selia								
|Silvy gasped . |	Silvy									
|No one had ever run so far and lived . |										
|`` The wards on Brine Cutter 's house held for most of the night , '' Selia went on . |	Brine Cutter	Selia								
|`` He and his family watched everything . |	Brine Cutter									
|A few others fled the corelings and succored there , until the fires spread and their roof caught . |										
|They waited in the burning house until the beams started to crack , and then took their chances outside in the minutes before dawn . |										
|The corelings killed Brine 's wife Meena and their son Poul , but the others made it . |	Brine Cutter	Meena	Poul							
|The burns will heal and the children will be all right in time , but the others ... '' She did n't need to finish the sentence . |	DEFAULT									
|Survivors of a demon attack had a way of dying soon after . |										
|Not all , or even most , but enough . |										
|Some of them took their own lives , and others simply stared blankly , refusing to eat or drink until they wasted away . |										
|It was said you did not truly survive an attack until a year and a day had passed . |										
|`` There are still a dozen unaccounted for , '' Selia said , but with little hope in her voice . |	Selia									
|`` We 'll dig them out , '' Jeph agreed grimly , looking at the collapsed houses , many still smoldering . |	Jeph									
|The cutters built their homes mostly out of stone to protect against fire , but even stone would burn if the wards failed and enough flame demons gathered in one place . |										
|Jeph joined the other men and a few of the stronger women in clearing the rubble and carting the dead to the pyre . |	Jeph									
|The bodies had to be burned , of course . |										
|No one would want to be buried in the same ground the demons rose out of each night . |										
|Tender Harral , the sleeves of his robe rolled up to bare his thick arms , lifted each into the fire himself , muttering prayers and drawing wards in the air as the flames took them . |	Harral									
|Silvy joined the other women in gathering the younger children and tending to the wounded under the watchful eye of the Brook 's Herb Gatherer , Coline Trigg . |	Silvy	Coline Trigg								
|But no herbs could ease the pain of the survivors . |										
|Brine Cutter , also called Brine Broad-shoulders , was a great bear of a man with a booming laugh who used to throw Arlen into the air when they came to trade for wood . |	Brine Cutter	Arlen								
|Now Brine sat in the ashes beside his ruined house , slowly knocking his head against the blackened wall . |	Brine Cutter									
|He muttered to himself and clutched his arms tightly , as if cold . |	Brine Cutter									
|Arlen and the other children were put to work carrying water and sorting through the woodpiles for salvageable lumber . |	Arlen									
|There were still a few warm months left to the year , but there would not be time to cut enough wood to last the winter . |										
|They would be burning dung again this year , and the house would reek . |										
|Again Arlen weathered a wave of guilt . |	Arlen									
|He was not in the pyre , nor banging his head in shock , having lost everything . |	Arlen									
|There were worse fates than a house smelling of dung . |										
|More and more villagers arrived as the morning wore on . |										
|Bringing their families and whatever provisions they could spare , they came from Fishing Hole and Town Square ; they came from the Boggin 's Hill , and Soggy Marsh . |										
|Some even came all the way from Southwatch . |										
|And one by one , Selia greeted them with the grim news and put them to work . |	Selia									
|With more than a hundred hands , the men doubled their efforts , half of them continuing to dig as the others descended upon the only salvageable structure left in the Cluster : Brine Cutter 's house . |	Brine Cutter									
|Selia led Brine away , somehow supporting the giant man as he stumbled , while the men cleared the rubble and began hauling new stones . |	Selia	Brine Cutter								
|A few took out warding kits and began to paint fresh wards while children made thatch . |										
|The house would be restored by nightfall . |										
|Arlen was partnered with Cobie Fisher in hauling wood . |	Arlen	Cobie								
|The children had amassed a sizable pile , though it was only a fraction of what had been lost . |										
|Cobie was a tall , thickly built boy with dark curls and hairy arms . |	Cobie									
|He was popular among the other children , but it was popularity built at others ' expense . |	Cobie									
|Few children cared to weather his insults , and fewer still his beatings . |	Cobie									
|Cobie had tortured Arlen for years , and the other children had gone along . |	Cobie	Arlen								
|Jeph 's farm was the northernmost in the Brook , far from where the children tended to gather in Town Square , and Arlen spent most of his free time wandering the Brook by himself . |	Jeph	Arlen								
|Sacrificing him to Cobie 's wrath seemed a fair trade to most children . |	Arlen	Cobie								
|Whenever Arlen went fishing , or passed by Fishing Hole on the way to Town Square , Cobie and his friends seemed to hear about it , and were waiting in the same spot on his way home . |	Arlen	Cobie								
|Sometimes they just called him names , or pushed him , but other times he came home bloody and bruised , and his mother shouted at him for fighting . |	Arlen									
|Finally , Arlen had enough . |	Arlen									
|He left a stout stick hidden in that spot , and the next time Cobie and his friends pounced , Arlen pretended to run , only to produce the weapon as if from thin air and come back swinging . |	Arlen	Cobie								
|Cobie was the first one struck , a hard blow that left him crying in the dirt with blood running from his ear . |	Cobie									
|Willum received a broken finger , and Gart walked with a limp for over a week . |	Willum	Gart								
|It had done nothing to improve Arlen 's popularity among the other children , and Arlen 's father had caned him , but the other boys never bothered him again . |	Arlen									
|Even now , Cobie gave him a wide berth and flinched if Arlen made a sudden move , even though he was bigger by far . |	Cobie	Arlen								
|`` Survivors ! '' |										
|Bil Baker called suddenly , standing by a collapsed house at the edge of the Cluster . |	Bil Baker									
|`` I can hear them trapped in the root cellar ! '' |	Bil Baker									
|Immediately , everyone dropped what they were doing and rushed over . |										
|Clearing the rubble would take too long , so the men began to dig , bending their backs with silent fervor . |										
|Soon after , they broke through the side of the cellar , and began hauling out the survivors . |										
|They were filthy and terrified , but all were very much alive . |										
|Three women , six children , and one man . |										
|`` Uncle Cholie ! '' |	Cholie									
|Arlen cried , and his mother was there in an instant , cradling her brother , who stumbled drunkenly . |	Arlen	DEFAULT								
|Arlen ran to them , ducking under his other arm to steady him . |	Arlen	Cholie								
|`` Cholie , what are you doing here ? '' |	Cholie									
|Silvy asked . |	Silvy									
|Cholie seldom left his workshop in Town Square . |	Cholie									
|Arlen 's mother had told the tale a thousand times of how she and her brother had run the farrier 's shop together before Jeph began breaking his horses ' shoes on purpose for a reason to come court . |	Arlen	DEFAULT	Jeph							
|`` Came to court Ana Cutter , '' Cholie mumbled . |	Ana Cutter	Cholie								
|He pulled at his hair , having already torn whole clumps free . |	Cholie									
|`` We 'd just opened the bolt-hole when they came through the wards ... '' His knees buckled , pulling Arlen and Silvy down with his weight . |	DEFAULT	Arlen	Silvy							
|Kneeling in the dirt , he wept . |	DEFAULT									
|Arlen looked at the other survivors . |	Arlen									
|Ana Cutter was n't among them . |	Ana Cutter									
|His throat tightened as the children passed . |	DEFAULT									
|He knew every one of them ; their families , what their houses were like inside and out , their animals ' names . |	DEFAULT									
|They met his eyes for a second as they went by , and in that moment , he lived the attack through their eyes . |	DEFAULT									
|He saw himself shoved into a cramped hole in the ground while those unable to fit turned to face the corelings and the fire . |	DEFAULT									
|Suddenly he started gasping , unable to stop until Jeph slapped him on the back and brought him to his senses . |	DEFAULT	Jeph								
|They were finishing a cold midday meal when a horn sounded on the far side of the Brook . |										
|`` Not two in one day ? '' |										
|Silvy gasped , covering her mouth . |	Silvy									
|`` Bah , '' Selia grunted . |	Selia									
|`` At midday ? |										
|Use your head , girl ! '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Then what ... ? '' |										
|Selia ignored her , rising to fetch a horn blower to signal back . |	Selia	DEFAULT								
|Keven Marsh had his horn ready , as the folks from Soggy Marsh always did . |	Keven									
|It was easy to get separated in the marshes , and no one wanted to be wandering lost when the swamp demons rose . |										
|Keven 's cheeks inflated like a frog 's chin as he blew a series of notes . |	Keven									
|`` Messenger horn , '' Coran Marsh advised Silvy . |	Coran	Silvy								
|A graybeard , he was Speaker for Soggy Marsh and Keven 's father . |	Keven									
|`` They prob ' ly saw the smoke . |										
|Keven 's telling â€™em what 's happened and where everyone is . '' |	Keven									
|`` A Messenger in spring ? '' |										
|Arlen asked . |	Arlen									
|`` I thought they come in the fall after harvest . |	Arlen									
|We only finished planting this past moon ! '' |										
|`` Messenger never came last fall , '' Coran said , spitting foamy brown juice from the root he was chewing through the gap of his missing teeth . |	Coran									
|`` We been worried sumpin ' happened . |										
|Thought we might not have a Messenger bring salt till next fall . |										
|Or maybe that the corelings got the Free Cities and we 's cut off . '' |										
|`` The corelings could never get the Free Cities , '' Arlen said . |	Arlen									
|`` Arlen , shush your mouth ! '' |	Arlen									
|Silvy hissed . |	Silvy									
|`` He 's your elder ! '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Let the boy speak , '' Coran said . |	DEFAULT	Coran								
|`` Ever bin to a free city , boy ? '' |	Coran									
|he asked Arlen . |	DEFAULT	Arlen								
|`` No , '' Arlen admitted . |	Arlen									
|`` Ever know anyone who had ? '' |										
|`` No , '' Arlen said again . |	Arlen									
|`` So what makes you such an expert ? '' |	Arlen									
|Coran asked . |	Coran									
|`` Ent no one been to one ' cept the Messengers . |										
|They 're the only ones what brave the night to go so far . |										
|Who 's to say the Free Cities ent just places like the Brook ? |										
|If the corelings can get us , they can get them , too . '' |										
|`` Old Hog is from the Free Cities , '' Arlen said . |	Rusco	Arlen								
|Rusco Hog was the richest man in the Brook . |	Rusco									
|He ran the general store , which was the crux of all commerce in Tibbet 's Brook . |	Rusco									
|`` Ay , '' Coran said , `` an ' old Hog told me years ago that one trip was enough for him . |	Coran	DEFAULT								
|He meant to go back after a few years , but said it was n't worth the risk . |	DEFAULT									
|So you ask him if the Free Cities are any safer than anywhere else . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Arlen did n't want to believe it . |	Arlen									
|There had to be safe places in the world . |										
|But again the image of himself being thrown into the cellar flashed across his mind , and he knew that nowhere was truly safe at night . |	DEFAULT									
|The Messenger arrived an hour later . |	DEFAULT									
|He was a tall man in his early thirties , with cropped brown hair and a short , thick beard . |	DEFAULT									
|Draped about his broad shoulders was a shirt of metal links , and he wore a long dark cloak with thick leather breeches and boots . |	DEFAULT									
|His mare was a sleek brown courser . |	DEFAULT									
|Strapped to the horse 's saddle was a harness holding a number of different spears . |										
|His face was grim as he approached , but his shoulders were high and proud . |	DEFAULT									
|He scanned the crowd and spotted the Speaker easily as she stood giving orders . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He turned his horse toward her . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Riding a few paces behind on a heavily laden cart pulled by a pair of dark brown mollies was the Jongleur . |	Jongleur									
|His clothes were a brightly colored patchwork , and he had a lute resting on the bench next to him . |	Jongleur									
|His hair was a color Arlen had never seen before , like a pale carrot , and his skin was so fair it seemed the sun had never touched it . |	DEFAULT	Arlen								
|His shoulders slumped , and he looked thoroughly exhausted . |	DEFAULT									
|There was always a Jongleur with the annual Messenger . |	Jongleur									
|To the children , and some of the adults , the Jongleur was the more important of the two . |	Jongleur									
|For as long as Arlen could remember , it had been the same man , gray-haired but spry and full of cheer . |	Arlen									
|This new one was younger , and he seemed sullen . |	DEFAULT									
|Children ran to him immediately , and the young Jongleur perked up , the frustration melting from his face so quickly Arlen began to doubt it was ever there . |	Jongleur	Arlen								
|In an instant , the Jongleur was off the cart and spinning his colored balls into the air as the children cheered . |	Jongleur									
|Others , Arlen among them , forgot their work , drifting toward the newcomers . |	Arlen									
|Selia whirled on them , having none of it . |	Selia									
|`` The day is no longer because the Messenger 's come ! '' |										
|she barked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Back to your work ! '' |										
|There were grumbles , but everyone went back to work . |										
|`` Not you , Arlen , '' Selia said . |	Arlen	Selia								
|`` Come here . '' |										
|Arlen pulled his eyes from the Jongleur and went to her as the Messenger arrived . |	Arlen	Jongleur	Selia	DEFAULT						
|`` Selia Barren ? '' |	Selia									
|the Messenger asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Just Selia will do , '' Selia replied primly . |	Selia									
|The Messenger 's eyes widened , and he blushed , the tops of his pale cheeks turning a deep red above his beard . |	DEFAULT									
|He leapt down from his horse and bowed low . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Apologies , '' he said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I did not think . |	DEFAULT									
|Graig , your usual Messenger , told me that 's what you were called . '' |	Graig	DEFAULT								
|`` It 's pleasing to know what Graig thinks of me after all these years , '' Selia said , sounding not at all pleased . |	Graig	Selia								
|`` Thought , '' the Messenger corrected . |	DEFAULT									
|`` He 's dead , maâ€™am . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Dead ? '' |										
|Selia asked , looking suddenly sad . |	Selia									
|`` Was it ... ? '' |										
|The Messenger shook his head . |	DEFAULT									
|`` It was a chill took him , not corelings . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm Ragen , your Messenger this year , as a favor to his widow . |	Ragen	DEFAULT								
|The guild will select a new Messenger for you starting next fall . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` A year and a half again before the next Messenger ? '' |										
|Selia asked , sounding like she was readying a scolding . |	Selia									
|`` We barely made it through this past winter without the fall salt , '' she said . |	Selia									
|`` I know you take it for granted in Miln , but half our meat and fish spoiled for lack of proper curing . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|And what of our letters ? '' |										
|`` Sorry , maâ€™am , '' Ragen said . |	DEFAULT	Ragen								
|`` Your towns are well off the common roads , and paying a Messenger to commit for a month and more of travel each year is costly . |	DEFAULT									
|The Messengers ' Guild is shorthanded , what with Graig catching that chill . '' |	Graig									
|He chuckled and shook his head , but noticed Selia 's visage darken in response . |	Ragen	Selia								
|`` No offense meant , maâ€™am , '' Ragen said . |	Ragen	Selia								
|`` He was my friend as well . |	DEFAULT	Ragen								
|It 's just ... it 's not many of us Messengers get to go with a roof above , a bed below , and a young wife at our side . |										
|The night usually gets us before that , you see ? '' |	Selia									
|`` I do , '' Selia said . |	Selia									
|`` Do you have a wife , Ragen ? '' |	Ragen									
|she asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Ay , '' the Messenger said , `` though to her pleasure and my pain , I see my mare more than my bride . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He laughed , confusing Arlen , who did n't think having a wife not miss you was funny . |	DEFAULT	Arlen								
|Selia did n't seem to notice . |	Selia									
|`` What if you could n't see her at all ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|she asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` What if all you had were letters once a year to connect you to her ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|How would you feel to hear your letters would be delayed half a year ? |	DEFAULT									
|There are some in this town with kin in the Free Cities . |										
|Left with one Messenger or another , some as much as two generations gone . |										
|Those people ent going to come home , Ragen . |	Ragen									
|Letters are all we have of them , and they of us . '' |										
|`` I am in full agreement with you , maâ€™am , '' Ragen said , `` but the decision is not mine to make . |	Ragen	DEFAULT								
|The duke ... '' `` But you will speak to the duke upon your return , yes ? '' |	Ragen	DEFAULT								
|Selia asked . |	Selia									
|`` I will , '' he said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Shall I write the message down for you ? '' |	Selia	DEFAULT								
|Selia asked . |	Selia									
|Ragen smiled . |	Ragen									
|`` I think I can remember it , maâ€™am . '' |	Ragen	DEFAULT								
|`` See that you do . '' |	Ragen									
|Ragen bowed again , still lower . |	Ragen									
|`` Apologies , for coming to call on such a dark day , '' he said , his eyes flicking to the funeral pyre . |	Ragen									
|`` We can not tell the rain when to come , nor the wind , nor the cold , '' Selia said . |	Selia									
|`` Not the corelings , either . |										
|So life must go on despite these things . '' |										
|`` Life goes on , '' Ragen agreed , `` but if there 's anything I or my Jongleur can do to help ; I 've a strong back and I 've treated coreling wounds many times . '' |	Ragen	Jongleur								
|`` Your Jongleur is helping already , '' Selia said , nodding toward the young man as he sang and did his tricks , `` distracting the young ones while their kin do their work . |	Ragen	Jongleur	Selia							
|As for you , I 've much to do over the next few days , if we 're to recover from this loss . |	DEFAULT	Selia								
|I wo n't have time to hand the mail and read to those who have n't learned their letters . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I can read to those who ca n't , maâ€™am , '' Ragen said , `` but I do n't know your town well enough to distribute . '' |	DEFAULT	Ragen								
|`` No need , '' Selia said , pulling Arlen forward . |	Selia	Arlen								
|`` Arlen here will take you to the general store in Town Square . |	Arlen									
|Give the letters and packages to Rusco Hog when you deliver the salt . |	Rusco	Arlen								
|Most everyone will come running now that the salt 's in , and Rusco 's one of the few in town with letters and numbers . |	Rusco									
|The old crook will complain and try to insist on payment , but you tell him that in time of trouble , the whole town must throw in . |	DEFAULT	Rusco								
|You tell him to give out the letters and read to those who ca n't , or I 'll not lift a finger the next time the town wants to throw a rope around his neck . '' |	Ragen	DEFAULT	Selia							
|Ragen looked closely at Selia , perhaps trying to tell if she was joking , but her stony face gave no indication . |	Ragen	Selia								
|He bowed again . |	Ragen									
|`` Hurry along , then , '' Selia said . |	Selia									
|`` Lift your feet and you 'll both be back as everyone is readying to leave here for the night . |	DEFAULT									
|If you and your Jongleur do n't want to pay Rusco for a room , any here will be glad to offer their homes . '' |	DEFAULT	Jongleur	Rusco							
|She shooed the two of them away and turned back to scold those pausing their work to stare at the newcomers . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Is she always so ... forceful ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Ragen asked Arlen as they walked over to where the Jongleur was mumming for the youngest children . |	Ragen	Arlen	Jongleur
