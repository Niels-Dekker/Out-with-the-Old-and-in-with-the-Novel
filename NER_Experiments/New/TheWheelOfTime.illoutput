the O

streamed O

He O

As O

worse O
than O

it O
must O

harsher O

if O
the O

Wolves O

It O

Men O

the O
prey O

sheep O

the O

Tam PER

taking O
steady O
strides O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
Bela PER

using O
his O
spear O
as O
a O
walking O
staff O
, O
ignoring O
the O
wind O
that O
made O
his O
brown O
cloak O
flap O
like O
a O
banner O
. O
Now O
and O
again O
he O
touched O
the O
mare O

flank O
lightly O
, O
to O
remind O
her O
to O
keep O
moving O

With O
his O
thick O
chest O

broad O
face O

he O
was O
a O
pillar O
of O
reality O
in O
that O
morning O
, O
like O
a O
stone O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
drifting O
dream O

His O
sun-roughened O
cheeks O
might O
be O
lined O
and O
his O
hair O
have O
only O
a O
sprinkling O
of O
black O
among O
the O
gray O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
solidness O
to O
him O
, O
as O
though O
a O
flood O
could O
wash O
around O
him O
without O
uprooting O
his O
feet O

He O
stumped O
down O
the O
road O
now O
impassively O
. O
Wolves O
and O
bears O
were O
all O
very O
well O

his O
manner O

things O
that O
any O

Tam PER

matter-of-factness O
reminding O
him O
of O
his O
task O

He O
was O
a O
head O

taller O

anyone O

Gray PER

the O

little O
of O
her O
aside O

Two O
small O
casks O

apple O

the O
lurching O

eight O

only O
slightly O

the O

every O
year O

for O
use O
during O
Bel PER
Tine PER
, O
and O
he O
had O
declared O
that O
it O
would O
take O
more O
than O
wolves O
or O
a O
cold O
wind O
to O
stop O
him O
this O
spring O
. O
Even O
so O
they O
had O
not O
been O
to O
the O
village O
for O
weeks O
. O
Not O
even O
Tam PER
traveled O
much O
these O
days O

But O
Tam PER
had O
given O
his O
word O
about O
the O
brandy O

cider O
, O
even O
if O
he O
had O
waited O
to O
make O
delivery O
until O
the O
day O
before O
Festival O

Keeping O
his O
word O
was O
important O
to O
Tam PER
. O
Rand PER
was O
just O
glad O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
farm O
, O
almost O
as O
glad O
as O
about O
the O
coming O
of O
Bel PER
Tine PER
. O
As O
Rand PER
watched O
his O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
the O
feeling O
grew O
in O
him O
that O
he O
was O
being O
watched O
. O
For O
a O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
shrug O
it O
off O
. O
Nothing O
moved O
or O
made O
a O
sound O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
except O
the O
wind O
. O
But O
the O
feeling O
not O
only O
persisted O
, O
it O
grew O
stronger O
. O
The O
hairs O
on O
his O
arms O
stirred O
; O
his O
skin O
prickled O
as O
if O
it O
itched O
on O
the O
inside O
. O
He O
shifted O
his O
bow O
irritably O
to O
rub O
at O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
told O
himself O
to O
stop O
letting O
fancies O
take O
him O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
in O
the O
woods O
on O
his O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
and O
Tam PER
would O
have O
spoken O
if O
there O
had O
been O
anything O
on O
the O
other O
. O
He O
glanced O
over O
his O
shoulder O
... O
and O
blinked O
. O
Not O
more O
than O
twenty O
spans O
back O
down O
the O
road O
a O
cloaked O
figure O
on O
horseback O
followed O
them O
, O
horse O
and O
rider O
alike O
black O
, O
dull O
and O
ungleaming O
. O
It O
was O
more O
habit O
than O
anything O
else O
that O
kept O
him O
walking O
backward O
alongside O
the O
cart O
even O
while O
he O
looked O
. O
The O
rider O
's O
cloak O
covered O
him O
to O
his O
boot O
tops O
, O
the O
cowl O
tugged O
well O
forward O
so O
no O
part O
of O
him O
showed O
. O
Vaguely O
Rand PER
thought O
there O
was O
something O
odd O
about O
the O
horseman O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
shadowed O
opening O
of O
the O
hood O
that O
fascinated O
him O
. O
He O
could O
see O
only O
the O
vaguest O
outlines O
of O
a O
face O
, O
but O
he O
had O
the O
feeling O
he O
was O
looking O
right O
into O
the O
rider O
's O
eyes O
. O
And O
he O
could O
not O
look O
away O
. O
Queasiness O
settled O
in O
his O
stomach O
. O
There O
was O
only O
shadow O
to O
see O
in O
the O
hood O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
hatred O
as O
sharply O
as O
if O
he O
could O
see O
a O
snarling O
face O
, O
hatred O
for O
everything O
that O
lived O
. O
Hatred O
for O
him O
most O
of O
all O
, O
for O
him O
above O
all O
things O
. O
Abruptly O
a O
stone O
caught O
his O
heel O
and O
he O
stumbled O
, O
breaking O
his O
eyes O
away O
from O
the O
dark O
horseman O
. O
His O
bow O
dropped O
to O
the O
road O
, O
and O
only O
an O
outthrust O
hand O
grabbing O
Bela PER
's O
harness O
saved O
him O
from O
falling O
flat O
on O
his O
back O
. O
With O
a O
startled O
snort O
the O
mare O
stopped O
, O
twisting O
her O
head O
to O
see O
what O
had O
caught O
her O
. O
Tam PER
frowned O
over O
Bela PER

back O

him O

" O

all O

The O

" O
Rand PER

words O
trailed O
off O
as O
he O
turned O
to O
point O
. O
The O
road O
behind O
was O
empty O
. O
Disbelieving O
, O
he O
stared O
into O
the O
forest O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
road O
. O
Bare-branched O
trees O
offered O
no O
hiding O
place O
, O
but O
there O
was O
not O
a O
glimmer O
of O
horse O

He O
met O
his O
father O

questioning O
gaze O

" O
He O

there O

he O

there O

He O
snatched O
up O
the O
fallen O

hastily O
checked O
the O
fletching O
before O

half O
drew O
before O

Abruptly O
Rand PER

what O
had O
been O
odd O
about O
the O
horseman O

aside O
from O
his O
being O
there O
at O
all O

The O
wind O
that O
beat O
at O
Tam PER

him O
had O
not O
so O
much O
as O
shifted O
a O
fold O

suddenly O
dry O

He O
