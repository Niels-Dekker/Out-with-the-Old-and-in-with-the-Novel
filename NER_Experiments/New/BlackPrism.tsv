|Though the adults shunned it and the children were forbidden to come here , he 'd played on the open field a hundred times -- during the day . |	Kip									
|Tonight , his purpose was grimmer . |	Kip									
|Reaching the top of the hill , Kip stood and hiked up his pants . |	Kip									
|The river behind him was hissing , or maybe that was the warriors beneath its surface , dead these sixteen years . |										
|He squared his shoulders , ignoring his imagination . |	DEFAULT									
|The mists made him seem suspended , outside of time . |	DEFAULT									
|But even if there was no evidence of it , the sun was coming . |										
|By the time it did , he had to get to the far side of the battlefield . |										
|Farther than he 'd ever gone searching . |	DEFAULT									
|Even Ramir would n't come out here at night . |	Ramir									
|Everyone knew Sundered Rock was haunted . |										
|But Ram did n't have to feed his family ; his mother did n't smoke her wages . |	Ramir	DEFAULT								
|Gripping his little belt knife tightly , Kip started walking . |	Kip									
|It was n't just the unquiet dead that might pull him down to the evernight . |	DEFAULT									
|A pack of giant javelinas had been seen roaming the night , tusks cruel , hooves sharp . |										
|They were good eating if you had a matchlock , iron nerves , and good aim , but since the Prisms ' War had wiped out all the town 's men , there were n't many people who braved death for a little bacon . |										
|Rekton was already a shell of what it had once been . |										
|The alcaldesa was n't eager for any of her townspeople to throw their lives away . |										
|Besides , Kip did n't have a matchlock . |	Kip									
|Nor were javelinas the only creatures that roamed the night . |										
|A mountain lion or a golden bear would also probably enjoy a well-marbled Kip . |	Kip									
|A low howl cut the mist and the darkness hundreds of paces deeper into the battlefield . |										
|Kip froze . |	Kip									
|Oh , there were wolves too . |										
|How 'd he forget wolves ? |	DEFAULT									
|Another wolf answered , farther out . |										
|A haunting sound , the very voice of the wilderness . |										
|You could n't help but freeze when you heard it . |										
|It was the kind of beauty that made you shit your pants . |										
|Wetting his lips , Kip got moving . |	Kip									
|He had the distinct sensation of being followed . |	Kip									
|Stalked . |										
|He looked over his shoulder . |	DEFAULT									
|There was nothing there . |										
|Of course . |										
|His mother always said he had too much imagination . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Just walk , Kip . |	Kip									
|Places to be . |										
|Animals are more scared of you and all that . |	DEFAULT									
|Besides , that was one of the tricks about a howl , it always sounded much closer than it really was . |										
|Those wolves were probably leagues away . |										
|Before the Prisms ' War , this had been excellent farmland . |										
|Right next to the Umber River , suitable for figs , grapes , pears , dewberries , asparagus -- everything grew here . |										
|And it had been sixteen years since the final battle -- a year before Kip was even born . |	Kip									
|But the plain was still torn and scarred . |										
|A few burnt timbers of old homes and barns poked out of the dirt . |										
|Deep furrows and craters remained from cannon shells . |										
|Filled now with swirling mist , those craters looked like lakes , tunnels , traps . |										
|Bottomless . |										
|Unfathomable . |										
|Most of the magic used in the battle had dissolved sooner or later in the years of sun exposure , but here and there broken green luxin spears still glittered . |										
|Shards of solid yellow underfoot would cut through the toughest shoe leather . |										
|Scavengers had long since taken all the valuable arms , mail , and luxin from the battlefield , but as the seasons passed and rains fell , more mysteries surfaced each year . |										
|That was what Kip was hoping for -- and what he was seeking was most visible in the first rays of dawn . |	Kip									
|The wolves stopped howling . |										
|Nothing was worse than hearing that chilling sound , but at least with the sound he knew where they were . |	Kip									
|Now ... Kip swallowed on the hard knot in his throat . |	Kip									
|As he walked in the valley of the shadow of two great unnatural hills -- the remnant of two of the great funeral pyres where tens of thousands had burned -- Kip saw something in the mist . |	Kip									
|His heart leapt into his throat . |	Kip									
|The curve of a mail cowl . |										
|A glint of eyes searching the darkness . |										
|Then it was swallowed up in the roiling mists . |										
|A ghost . |										
|Dear Orholam . |	Orholam									
|Some spirit keeping watch at its grave . |										
|Look on the bright side . |										
|Maybe wolves are scared of ghosts . |										
|Kip realized he 'd stopped walking , peering into the darkness . |	Kip									
|Move , fathead . |	Kip									
|He moved , keeping low . |	DEFAULT									
|He might be big , but he prided himself on being light on his feet . |	DEFAULT									
|He tore his eyes away from the hill -- still no sign of the ghost or man or whatever it was . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He had that feeling again that he was being stalked . |	DEFAULT									
|He looked back . |	DEFAULT									
|Nothing . |										
|A quick click , like someone dropping a small stone . |										
|And something at the corner of his eye . |	Kip									
|Kip shot a look up the hill . |	Kip									
|A click , a spark , the striking of flint against steel . |										
|The mists illuminated for that briefest moment , Kip saw few details . |	Kip									
|Not a ghost -- a soldier striking a flint , trying to light a slow-match . |										
|It caught fire , casting a red glow on the soldier 's face , making his eyes seem to glow . |										
|He affixed the slow-match to the match-holder of his matchlock and spun , looking for targets in the darkness . |	DEFAULT									
|His night vision must have been ruined by staring at the brief flame on his match , now a smoldering red ember , because his eyes passed right over Kip . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|The soldier turned again , sharply , paranoid . |										
|`` The hell am I supposed to see out here , anyway ? |	DEFAULT									
|Swivin ' wolves . '' |										
|Very , very carefully , Kip started walking away . |	Kip									
|He had to get deeper into the mist and darkness before the soldier 's night vision recovered , but if he made noise , the man might fire blindly . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Kip walked on his toes , silently , his back itching , sure that a lead ball was going to tear through him at any moment . |	Kip									
|But he made it . |	Kip									
|A hundred paces , more , and no one yelled . |										
|No shot cracked the night . |										
|Farther . |										
|Two hundred paces more , and he saw light off to his left , a campfire . |	DEFAULT									
|It had burned so low it was barely more than coals now . |										
|Kip tried not to look directly at it to save his vision . |	Kip									
|There was no tent , no bedrolls nearby , just the fire . |										
|Kip tried Master Danavis 's trick for seeing in darkness . |	Kip	Master Danavis								
|He let his focus relax and tried to view things from the periphery of his vision . |	Kip									
|Nothing but an irregularity , perhaps . |										
|He moved closer . |	DEFAULT									
|Two men lay on the cold ground . |										
|One was a soldier . |										
|Kip had seen his mother unconscious plenty of times ; he knew instantly this man was n't passed out . |	Kip	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|He was sprawled unnaturally , there were no blankets , and his mouth hung open , slack-jawed , eyes staring unblinking at the night . |	DEFAULT									
|Next to the dead soldier lay another man , bound in chains but alive . |										
|He lay on his side , hands manacled behind his back , a black bag over his head and cinched tight around his neck . |	DEFAULT									
|The prisoner was alive , trembling . |										
|No , weeping . |										
|Kip looked around ; there was no one else in sight . |	Kip									
|`` Why do n't you just finish it , damn you ? '' |	Kip									
|the prisoner said . |	DEFAULT									
|Kip froze . |	Kip									
|He thought he 'd approached silently . |	Kip									
|`` Coward , '' the prisoner said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Just following your orders , I suppose ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Orholam will smite you for what you 're about to do to that little town . '' |	Orholam	Kip								
|Kip had no idea what the man was talking about . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Apparently his silence spoke for him . |	Kip									
|`` You 're not one of them . '' |	DEFAULT									
|A note of hope entered the prisoner 's voice . |										
|`` Please , help me ! '' |	DEFAULT									
|Kip stepped forward . |	Kip									
|The man was suffering . |	DEFAULT									
|Then he stopped . |	DEFAULT									
|Looked at the dead soldier . |										
|The front of the soldier 's shirt was soaked with blood . |										
|Had this prisoner killed him ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|How ? |										
|`` Please , leave me chained if you must . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|But please , I do n't want to die in darkness . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Kip stayed back , though it felt cruel . |	Kip									
|`` You killed him ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I 'm supposed to be executed at first light . |	DEFAULT									
|I got away . |	DEFAULT									
|He chased me down and got the bag over my head before he died . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|If dawn 's close , his replacement is coming anytime now . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Kip still was n't putting it together . |	Kip									
|No one in Rekton trusted the soldiers who came through , and the alcaldesa had told the town 's young people to give any soldiers a wide berth for a while -- apparently the new satrap Garadul had declared himself free of the Chromeria 's control . |	King Garadul									
|Now he was King Garadul , he said , but he wanted the usual levies from the town 's young people . |	King Garadul									
|The alcaldesa had told his representative that if he was n't the satrap anymore , he did n't have the right to raise levies . |	King Garadul									
|King or satrap , Garadul could n't be happy with that , but Rekton was too small to bother with . |	King Garadul									
|Still , it would be wise to avoid his soldiers until this all blew over . |	King Garadul									
|On the other hand , just because Rekton was n't getting along with the satrap right now did n't make this man Kip 's friend . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` So you are a criminal ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Kip asked . |	Kip									
|`` Of six shades to Sun Day , '' the man said . |	DEFAULT									
|The hope leaked out of his voice . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Look , boy -- you are a child , are n't you ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|You sound like one . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm going to die today . |	DEFAULT									
|I ca n't get away . |	DEFAULT									
|Truth to tell , I do n't want to . |	DEFAULT									
|I 've run enough . |	DEFAULT									
|This time , I fight . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` I do n't understand . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` You will . |	DEFAULT									
|Take off my hood . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Though some vague doubt nagged Kip , he untied the half-knot around the man 's neck and pulled off the hood . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|At first , Kip had no idea what the prisoner was talking about . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|The man sat up , arms still bound behind his back . |	DEFAULT									
|He was perhaps thirty years old , Tyrean like Kip but with a lighter complexion , his hair wavy rather than kinky , his limbs thin and muscular . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Then Kip saw his eyes . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Men and women who could harness light and make luxin -- drafters -- always had unusual eyes . |										
|A little residue of whatever color they drafted ended up in their eyes . |										
|Over the course of their life , it would stain the entire iris red , or blue , or whatever their color was . |										
|The prisoner was a green drafter -- or had been . |										
|Instead of the green being bound in a halo within the iris , it was shattered like crockery smashed to the floor . |										
|Little green fragments glowed even in the whites of his eyes . |	DEFAULT									
|Kip gasped and shrank back . |	Kip									
|`` Please ! '' |										
|the man said . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Please , the madness is n't on me . |	DEFAULT									
|I wo n't hurt you . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` You 're a color wight . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` And now you know why I ran away from the Chromeria , '' the man said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Because the Chromeria put down color wights like a farmer put down a beloved , rabid dog . |										
|Kip was on the verge of bolting , but the man was n't making any threatening moves . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|And besides , it was still dark . |										
|Even color wights needed light to draft . |										
|The mist did seem lighter , though , gray beginning to touch the horizon . |										
|It was crazy to talk to a madman , but maybe it was n't too crazy . |										
|At least until dawn . |										
|The color wight was looking at Kip oddly . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` Blue eyes . '' |										
|He laughed . |	DEFAULT									
|Kip scowled . |	Kip									
|He hated his blue eyes . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|It was one thing when a foreigner like Master Danavis had blue eyes . |	Master Danavis									
|They looked fine on him . |	Master Danavis									
|Kip looked freakish . |	Kip									
|`` What 's your name ? '' |	Kip									
|the color wight asked . |	DEFAULT									
|Kip swallowed , thinking he should probably run away . |	Kip									
|`` Oh , for Orholam 's sake , you think I 'm going to hex you with your name ? |	Orholam	Kip	DEFAULT							
|How ignorant is this backwater ? |										
|That is n't how chromaturgy works -- '' `` Kip . '' |	Kip									
|The color wight grinned . |										
|`` Kip . |	Kip									
|Well , Kip , have you ever wondered why you were stuck in such a small life ? |	Kip									
|Have you ever gotten the feeling , Kip , that you 're special ? '' |	Kip									
|Kip said nothing . |	Kip									
|Yes , and yes . |										
|`` Do you know why you feel destined for something greater ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Why ? '' |										
|Kip asked , quiet , hopeful . |	Kip									
|`` Because you 're an arrogant little shit . '' |	Kip									
|The color wight laughed . |	DEFAULT									
|Kip should n't have been taken off guard . |	Kip									
|His mother had said worse . |	DEFAULT									
|Still , it took him a moment . |	DEFAULT									
|A small failure . |										
|`` Burn in hell , coward , '' he said . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` You 're not even good at running away . |	DEFAULT									
|Caught by ironfoot soldiers . '' |										
|The color wight laughed louder . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Oh , they did n't catch me . |	DEFAULT									
|They recruited me . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Who would recruit madmen to join them ? |										
|`` They did n't know you were a -- '' `` Oh , they knew . '' |	Kip									
|Dread like a weight dropped into Kip 's stomach . |	Kip									
|`` You said something about my town . |	DEFAULT	Kip								
|Before . |										
|What are they planning to do ? '' |										
|`` You know , Orholam 's got a sense of humor . |	Orholam	DEFAULT								
|Never realized that till now . |										
|Orphan , are n't you ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` No . |										
|I 've got a mother , '' Kip said . |	Kip									
|He instantly regretted giving the color wight even that much . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Would you believe me if I told you there 's a prophecy about you ? '' |	DEFAULT	Kip								
|`` It was n't funny the first time , '' Kip said . |	Kip									
|`` What 's going to happen to my town ? '' |	Kip									
|Dawn was coming , and Kip was n't going to stick around . |	Kip									
|Not only would the guard 's replacement come then , but Kip had no idea what the wight would do once he had light . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` You know , '' the wight said , `` you 're the reason I 'm here . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Not here here . |										
|Not like ` Why do I exist ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|Not in Tyrea . |										
|In chains , I mean . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` What ? '' |										
|Kip asked . |	Kip									
|`` There 's power in madness , Kip . |	Kip									
|Of course ... '' He trailed off , laughed at a private thought . |	DEFAULT									
|Recovered . |										
|`` Look , that soldier has a key in his breast pocket . |										
|I could n't get it out , not with -- '' He shook his hands , bound and manacled behind his back . |	DEFAULT									
|`` And I would help you why ? '' |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Kip asked . |	Kip									
|`` For a few straight answers before dawn . '' |										
|Crazy , and cunning . |										
|Perfect . |										
|`` Give me one first , '' Kip said . |	Kip									
|`` Shoot . '' |										
|`` What 's the plan for Rekton ? '' |										
|`` Fire . '' |										
|`` What ? '' |										
|Kip asked . |	Kip									
|`` Sorry , you said one answer . '' |	Kip									
|`` That was no answer ! '' |										
|`` They 're going to wipe out your village . |	DEFAULT									
|Make an example so no one else defies King Garadul . |	King Garadul									
|Other villages defied the king too , of course . |	King Garadul									
|His rebellion against the Chromeria is n't popular everywhere . |	King Garadul									
|For every town burning to take vengeance on the Prism , there 's another that wants nothing to do with war . |										
|Your village was chosen specially . |	DEFAULT									
|Anyway , I had a little spasm of conscience and objected . |	DEFAULT									
|Words were exchanged . |										
|I punched my superior . |	DEFAULT									
|Not totally my fault . |										
|They know us greens do n't do rules and hierarchy . |										
|Especially not once we 've broken the halo . '' |										
|The color wight shrugged . |	DEFAULT									
|`` There , straight . |										
|I think that deserves the key , do n't you ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It was too much information to soak up at once -- broken the halo ? |										
|-- but it was a straight answer . |										
|Kip walked over to the dead man . |	Kip									
|His skin was pallid in the rising light . |	DEFAULT									
|Pull it together , Kip . |	Kip									
|Ask whatever you need to ask . |	Kip									
|Kip could tell that dawn was coming . |	Kip									
|Eerie shapes were emerging from the night . |										
|The great twin looming masses of Sundered Rock itself were visible mostly as a place where stars were blotted out of the sky . |										
|What do I need to ask ? |	DEFAULT									
|He was hesitating , not wanting to touch the dead man . |	DEFAULT									
|He knelt . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Why my town ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|He poked through the dead man 's pocket , careful not to touch skin . |	DEFAULT									
|It was there , two keys . |										
|`` They think you have something that belongs to the king . |	DEFAULT	King Garadul								
|I do n't know what . |	DEFAULT									
|I only picked up that much by eavesdropping . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` What would Rekton have that the king wants ? '' |	King Garadul									
|Kip asked . |	Kip									
|`` Not Rekton you . |										
|You you . '' |										
|It took Kip a second . |	Kip									
|He touched his own chest . |	Kip									
|`` Me ? |	DEFAULT									
|Me personally ? |	DEFAULT									
|I do n't even own anything ! '' |	Kip									
|The color wight gave a crazy grin , but Kip thought it was a pretense . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` Tragic mistake , then . |										
|Their mistake , your tragedy . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` What , you think I 'm lying ?! '' |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Kip asked . |	Kip									
|`` You think I 'd be out here scavenging luxin if I had any other choice ? '' |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` I do n't really care one way or the other . |	DEFAULT									
|You going to bring that key over here , or do I need to ask real nice ? '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|It was a mistake to bring the keys over . |										
|Kip knew it . |	Kip									
|The color wight was n't stable . |										
|He was dangerous . |	DEFAULT									
|He 'd admitted as much . |	DEFAULT									
|But he had kept his word . |	Kip									
|How could Kip do less ? |	Kip									
|Kip unlocked the man 's manacles , and then the padlock on the chains . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|He backed away carefully , as one would from a wild animal . |	Kip									
|The color wight pretended not to notice , simply rubbing his arms and stretching back and forth . |										
|He moved over to the guard and poked through his pockets again . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His hand emerged with a pair of green spectacles with one cracked lens . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You could come with me , '' Kip said . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` If what you said is true -- '' `` How close do you think I 'd get to your town before someone came running with a musket ? |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|Besides , once the sun comes up ... I 'm ready for it to be done . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The color wight took a deep breath , staring at the horizon . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Tell me , Kip , if you 've done bad things your whole life , but you die doing something good , do you think that makes up for all the bad ? '' |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` No , '' Kip said , honestly , before he could stop himself . |	Kip									
|`` Me neither . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` But it 's better than nothing , '' Kip said . |	Kip									
|`` Orholam is merciful . '' |	Orholam									
|`` Wonder if you 'll say that after they 're done with your village . '' |	DEFAULT									
|There were other questions Kip wanted to ask , but everything had happened in such a rush that he could n't put his thoughts together . |	Kip									
|In the rising light Kip saw what had been hidden in the fog and the darkness . |	Kip									
|Hundreds of tents were laid out in military precision . |										
|Soldiers . |										
|Lots of soldiers . |										
|And even as Kip stood , not two hundred paces from the nearest tent , the plain began winking . |	Kip									
|Glimmers sparkled as broken luxin gleamed , like stars scattered on the ground , answering their brethren in the sky . |										
|It was what Kip had come for . |	Kip									
|Usually when a drafter released luxin , it simply dissolved , no matter what color it was . |										
|But in battle , there had been so much chaos , so many drafters , some sealed magic had been buried and protected from the sunlight that would break it down . |										
|The recent rain had uncovered more . |										
|But Kip 's eyes were pulled from the winking luxin by four soldiers and a man with a stark red cloak and red spectacles walking toward them from the camp . |	Kip									
|`` My name is Gaspar , by the by . |	Gaspar									
|Gaspar Elos . '' |	Gaspar									
|The color wight did n't look at Kip . |	Kip	DEFAULT								
|`` What ? '' |										
|`` I 'm not just some drafter . |	DEFAULT									
|My father loved me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I had plans . |	DEFAULT									
|A girl . |										
|A life . '' |										
|`` I do n't -- '' `` You will . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The color wight put the green spectacles on ; they fit perfectly , tight to his face , lenses sweeping to either side so that wherever he looked , he would be looking through a green filter . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Now get out of here . '' |										
|As the sun touched the horizon , Gaspar sighed . |	Gaspar									
|It was as if Kip had ceased to exist . |	Kip									
|It was like watching his mother take that first deep breath of haze . |	DEFAULT									
|Between the sparkling spars of darker green , the whites of Gaspar 's eyes swirled like droplets of green blood hitting water , first dispersing , then staining the whole . |	Gaspar									
|The emerald green of luxin ballooned through his eyes , thickened until it was solid , and then spread . |	Gaspar									
|Through his cheeks , up to his hairline , then down his neck , standing out starkly when it finally filled his lighter fingernails as if they 'd been painted in radiant jade . |	Gaspar									
|Gaspar started laughing . |	Gaspar									
|It was a low , unreasoning cackle , unrelenting . |										
|Mad . |										
|Not a pretense this time . |										
|Kip ran . |	Kip									
|He reached the funerary hill where the sentry had been , taking care to stay on the far side from the army . |	Kip									
|He had to get to Master Danavis . |	Kip	Master Danavis								
|Master Danavis always knew what to do . |	Master Danavis									
|There was no sentry on the hill now . |										
|Kip turned around in time to see Gaspar change , transform . |	Kip	Gaspar								
|Green luxin spilled out of his hands onto his body , covering every part of him like a shell , like an enormous suit of armor . |	Gaspar									
|Kip could n't see the soldiers or the red drafter approaching Gaspar , but he did see a fireball the size of his head streak toward the color wight , hit his chest , and burst apart , throwing flames everywhere . |	Kip	Gaspar								
|Gaspar rammed through it , flaming red luxin sticking to his green armor . |	Gaspar									
|He was magnificent , terrible , powerful . |	Gaspar									
|He ran toward the soldiers , screaming defiance , and disappeared from Kip 's view . |	DEFAULT	Kip								
|Kip fled , the vermilion sun setting fire to the mists . |	Kip
