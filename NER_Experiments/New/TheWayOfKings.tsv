|The enormous stone beast lay on its side , riblike protrusions from its chest broken and cracked . |										
|The monstrosity was vaguely skeletal in shape , with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite shoulders . |										
|The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face , as if created by a fire burning deep within the stone . |										
|They faded . |										
|Even after all these centuries , seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver . |	Kalak									
|The beast 's hand was as long as a man was tall . |										
|He 'd been killed by hands like those before , and it had n't been pleasant . |	DEFAULT									
|Of course , dying rarely was . |										
|He rounded the creature , picking his way more carefully across the battlefield . |	DEFAULT									
|The plain was a place of misshapen rock and stone , natural pillars rising around him , bodies littering the ground . |	DEFAULT									
|Few plants lived here . |										
|The stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars . |										
|Some were shattered , blasted-out sections where Surgebinders had fought . |										
|Less frequently , he passed cracked , oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray . |	DEFAULT									
|Many of the bodies around him were human ; many were not . |	DEFAULT									
|Blood mixed . |										
|Red . |										
|Orange . |										
|Violet . |										
|Though none of the bodies around him stirred , an indistinct haze of sounds hung in the air . |	DEFAULT									
|Moans of pain , cries of grief . |										
|They did not seem like the sounds of victory . |										
|Smoke curled from the occasional patches of growth or heaps of burning corpses . |										
|Even some sections of rock smoldered . |										
|The Dustbringers had done their work well . |										
|But I survived , Kalak thought , hand to breast as he hastened to the meeting place . |	Kalak									
|I actually survived this time . |	Kalak									
|That was dangerous . |										
|When he died , he was sent back , no choice . |	DEFAULT									
|When he survived the Desolation , he was supposed to go back as well . |	DEFAULT									
|Back to that place that he dreaded . |	DEFAULT									
|Back to that place of pain and fire . |										
|What if he just decided ... not to go ? |	DEFAULT									
|Perilous thoughts , perhaps traitorous thoughts . |										
|He hastened on his way . |	DEFAULT									
|The place of meeting was in the shadow of a large rock formation , a spire rising into the sky . |										
|As always , the ten of them had decided upon it before the battle . |										
|The survivors would make their way here . |										
|Oddly , only one of the others was waiting for him . |	DEFAULT									
|Jezrien . |	Jezrien									
|Had the other eight all died ? |										
|It was possible . |										
|The battle had been so furious this time , one of the worst . |										
|The enemy was growing increasingly tenacious . |										
|But no . |										
|Kalak frowned as he stepped up to the base of the spire . |	Kalak									
|Seven magnificent swords stood proudly here , driven point-first into the stone ground . |										
|Each was a masterly work of art , flowing in design , inscribed with glyphs and patterns . |										
|He recognized each one . |	DEFAULT									
|If their masters had died , the Blades would have vanished . |										
|These Blades were weapons of power beyond even Shardblades . |										
|These were unique . |										
|Precious . |										
|Jezrien stood outside the ring of swords , looking eastward . |	Jezrien									
|`` Jezrien ? '' |	Jezrien									
|The figure in white and blue glanced toward him . |	Jezrien									
|Even after all these centuries , Jezrien looked young , like a man barely into his thirtieth year . |	Jezrien									
|His short black beard was neatly trimmed , though his once-fine clothing was scorched and stained with blood . |	DEFAULT									
|He folded his arms behind his back as he turned to Kalak . |	Jezrien	Kalak								
|`` What is this , Jezrien ? '' |	Jezrien									
|Kalak asked . |	Kalak									
|`` Where are the others ? '' |										
|`` Departed . '' |										
|Jezrien 's voice was calm , deep , regal . |	Jezrien									
|Though he had n't worn a crown in centuries , his royal manner lingered . |	Jezrien									
|He always seemed to know what to do . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You might call it a miracle . |	DEFAULT									
|Only one of us died this time . '' |										
|`` Talenel , '' Kalak said . |	Talenel	Kalak								
|His was the only Blade unaccounted for . |	Talenel									
|`` Yes . |										
|He died holding that passage by the northern waterway . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Kalak nodded . |	Kalak									
|Taln had a tendency to choose seemingly hopeless fights and win them . |	Taln									
|He also had a tendency to die in the process . |	Taln									
|He would be back now , in the place where they went between Desolations . |	DEFAULT									
|The place of nightmares . |										
|Kalak found himself shaking . |	Kalak									
|When had he become so weak ? |	Kalak									
|`` Jezrien , I ca n't return this time . '' |	Jezrien	Kalak								
|Kalak whispered the words , stepping up and gripping the other man 's arm . |	Kalak									
|`` I ca n't . '' |	Kalak									
|Kalak felt something within him break at the admission . |	Kalak									
|How long had it been ? |										
|Centuries , perhaps millennia , of torture . |										
|It was so hard to keep track . |										
|Those fires , those hooks , digging into his flesh anew each day . |	DEFAULT									
|Searing the skin off his arm , then burning the fat , then driving to the bone . |										
|He could smell it . |	DEFAULT									
|Almighty , he could smell it ! |	DEFAULT									
|`` Leave your sword , '' Jezrien said . |	DEFAULT	Jezrien								
|`` What ? '' |										
|Jezrien nodded to the ring of weapons . |	Jezrien									
|`` I was chosen to wait for you . |	Jezrien	DEFAULT								
|We were n't certain if you had survived . |	DEFAULT									
|A ... a decision has been made . |										
|It is time for the Oathpact to end . '' |										
|Kalak felt a sharp stab of horror . |	Kalak									
|`` What will that do ? '' |										
|`` Ishar believes that so long as there is one of us still bound to the Oathpact , it may be enough . |	Ishar									
|There is a chance we might end the cycle of Desolations . '' |										
|Kalak looked into the immortal king 's eyes . |	Kalak									
|Black smoke rose from a small patch to their left . |										
|Groans of the dying haunted them from behind . |										
|There , in Jezrien 's eyes , Kalak saw anguish and grief . |	Jezrien	Kalak								
|Perhaps even cowardice . |										
|This was a man hanging from a cliff by a thread . |										
|Almighty above , Kalak thought . |	Kalak									
|You 're broken too , are n't you ? |	DEFAULT									
|They all were . |										
|Kalak turned and walked to the side , where a low ridge overlooked part of the battlefield . |	Kalak									
|There were so many corpses , and among them walked the living . |										
|Men in primitive wraps , carrying spears topped by bronze heads . |										
|Juxtaposed between them were others in gleaming plate armor . |										
|One group walked past , four men in their ragged tanned skins or shoddy leather joining a powerful figure in beautiful silver plate , amazingly intricate . |										
|Such a contrast . |										
|Jezrien stepped up beside him . |	Jezrien	Kalak								
|`` They see us as divinities , '' Kalak whispered . |	Kalak									
|`` They rely upon us , Jezrien . |	Jezrien									
|We 're all that they have . '' |										
|`` They have the Radiants . |										
|That will be enough . '' |										
|Kalak shook his head . |	Kalak									
|`` He will not remain bound by this . |	DEFAULT									
|The enemy . |										
|He will find a way around it . |	DEFAULT									
|You know he will . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Perhaps . '' |										
|The king of Heralds offered no further explanation . |										
|`` And Taln ? '' |	Taln									
|Kalak asked . |	Kalak									
|The flesh burning . |										
|The fires . |										
|The pain over and over and over ... `` Better that one man should suffer than ten , '' Jezrien whispered . |	Jezrien									
|He seemed so cold . |	Jezrien									
|Like a shadow caused by heat and light falling on someone honorable and true , casting this black imitation behind . |										
|Jezrien walked back to the ring of swords . |	Jezrien									
|His own Blade formed in his hands , appearing from mist , wet with condensation . |	Jezrien									
|`` It has been decided , Kalak . |	Kalak									
|We will go our ways , and we will not seek out one another . |										
|Our Blades must be left . |										
|The Oathpact ends now . '' |										
|He lifted his sword and rammed it into the stone with the other seven . |	Jezrien									
|Jezrien hesitated , looking at the sword , then bowed his head and turned away . |	Jezrien									
|As if ashamed . |										
|`` We chose this burden willingly . |										
|Well , we can choose to drop it if we wish . '' |										
|`` What do we tell the people , Jezrien ? '' |	Jezrien									
|Kalak asked . |	Kalak									
|`` What will they say of this day ? '' |										
|`` It 's simple , '' Jezrien said , walking away . |	Jezrien									
|`` We tell them that they finally won . |										
|It 's an easy enough lie . |										
|Who knows ? |										
|Maybe it will turn out to be true . '' |										
|Kalak watched Jezrien depart across the burned landscape . |	Kalak	Jezrien								
|Finally , he summoned his own Blade and slammed it into the stone beside the other eight . |	Kalak									
|He turned and walked in the direction opposite from Jezrien . |	DEFAULT	Jezrien								
|And yet , he could not help glancing back at the ring of swords and the single open spot . |	Jezrien									
|The place where the tenth sword should have gone . |										
|The one of them who was lost . |										
|The one they had abandoned . |										
|Forgive us , Kalak thought , then left . |	Kalak									
|Map of Alethkar and surroundings , created by His Majesty Gavilar Kholin 's royal surveyors , circa 1167 . |	Gavilar									
|`` The love of men is a frigid thing , a mountain stream only three steps from the ice . |										
|We are his . |	DEFAULT									
|Oh Stormfather ... we are his . |	DEFAULT									
|It is but a thousand days , and the Everstorm comes . '' |										
|-- Collected on the first day of the week Palah of the month Shash of the year 1171 , thirty-one seconds before death . |										
|Subject was a darkeyed pregnant woman of middle years . |										
|The child did not survive . |										
|Szeth-son-son-Vallano , Truthless of Shinovar , wore white on the day he was to kill a king . |	Szeth									
|The white clothing was a Parshendi tradition , foreign to him . |	Szeth									
|But he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation . |	DEFAULT									
|He sat in a large stone room , baked by enormous firepits that cast a garish light upon the revelers , causing beads of sweat to form on their skin as they danced , and drank , and yelled , and sang , and clapped . |	DEFAULT									
|Some fell to the ground red-faced , the revelry too much for them , their stomachs proving to be inferior wineskins . |										
|They looked as if they were dead , at least until their friends carried them out of the feast hall to waiting beds . |										
|Szeth did not sway to the drums , drink the sapphire wine , or stand to dance . |	Szeth									
|He sat on a bench at the back , a still servant in white robes . |	Szeth									
|Few at the treaty-signing celebration noticed him . |	Shin									
|He was just a servant , and Shin were easy to ignore . |	Shin									
|Most out here in the East thought Szeth 's kind were docile and harmless . |	DEFAULT									
|They were generally right . |										
|The drummers began a new rhythm . |										
|The beats shook Szeth like a quartet of thumping hearts , pumping waves of invisible blood through the room . |	Szeth									
|Szeth 's masters -- who were dismissed as savages by those in more civilized kingdoms -- sat at their own tables . |	Szeth									
|They were men with skin of black marbled with red . |										
|Parshendi , they were named -- cousins to the more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world . |										
|An oddity . |										
|They did not call themselves Parshendi ; this was the Alethi name for them . |										
|It meant , roughly , `` parshmen who can think . '' |										
|Neither side seemed to see that as an insult . |										
|The Parshendi had brought the musicians . |										
|At first , the Alethi lighteyes had been hesitant . |										
|To them , drums were base instruments of the common , darkeyed people . |										
|But wine was the great assassin of both tradition and propriety , and now the Alethi elite danced with abandon . |										
|Szeth stood and began to pick his way through the room . |	Szeth									
|The revelry had lasted long ; even the king had retired hours ago . |										
|But many still celebrated . |										
|As he walked , Szeth was forced to step around Dalinar Kholin -- the king 's own brother -- who slumped drunken at a small table . |	Szeth	Dalinar								
|The aging but powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried to encourage him to bed . |	Dalinar									
|Where was Jasnah , the king 's daughter ? |	Jasnah									
|Elhokar , the king 's son and heir , sat at the high table , ruling the feast in his father 's absence . |	Elhokar									
|He was in conversation with two men , a dark-skinned Azish man who had an odd patch of pale skin on his cheek and a thinner , Alethi-looking man who kept glancing over his shoulder . |	Elhokar									
|The heir 's feasting companions were unimportant . |										
|Szeth stayed far from the heir , skirting the sides of the room , passing the drummers . |	Szeth									
|Musicspren zipped through the air around them , the tiny spirits taking the form of spinning translucent ribbons . |										
|As Szeth passed the drummers , they noted him . |	Szeth									
|They would withdraw soon , along with all of the other Parshendi . |										
|They did not seem offended . |										
|They did not seem angry . |										
|And yet they were going to break their treaty of only a few hours . |										
|It made no sense . |										
|But Szeth did not ask questions . |	Szeth									
|At the edge of the room , he passed rows of unwavering azure lights that bulged out where wall met floor . |	Szeth									
|They held sapphires infused with Stormlight . |										
|Profane . |										
|How could the men of these lands use something so sacred for mere illumination ? |										
|Worse , the Alethi scholars were said to be close to creating new Shardblades . |										
|Szeth hoped that was just wishful boasting . |	Szeth									
|For if it did happen , the world would be changed . |										
|Likely in a way that ended with people in all countries -- from distant Thaylenah to towering Jah Keved -- speaking Alethi to their children . |										
|They were a grand people , these Alethi . |										
|Even drunk , there was a natural nobility to them . |										
|Tall and well made , the men dressed in dark silk coats that buttoned down the sides of the chest and were elaborately embroidered in silver or gold . |										
|Each one looked a general on the field . |										
|The women were even more splendid . |										
|They wore grand silk dresses , tightly fitted , the bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the men . |										
|The left sleeve of each dress was longer than the right one , covering the hand . |										
|Alethi had an odd sense of propriety . |										
|Their pure black hair was pinned up atop their heads , either in intricate weavings of braids or in loose piles . |										
|It was often woven with gold ribbons or ornaments , along with gems that glowed with Stormlight . |										
|Beautiful . |										
|Profane , but beautiful . |										
|Szeth left the feasting chamber behind . |	Szeth									
|Just outside , he passed the doorway into the Beggars ' Feast . |	Szeth									
|It was an Alethi tradition , a room where some of the poorest men and women in the city were given a feast complementing that of the king and his guests . |										
|A man with a long grey and black beard slumped in the doorway , smiling foolishly -- though whether from wine or a weak mind , Szeth could not tell . |	DEFAULT	Szeth								
|`` Have you seen me ? '' |	Szeth	DEFAULT								
|the man asked with slurred speech . |	DEFAULT									
|He laughed , then began to speak in gibberish , reaching for a wineskin . |	DEFAULT									
|So it was drink after all . |										
|Szeth brushed by , continuing past a line of statues depicting the Ten Heralds from ancient Vorin theology . |	Szeth									
|Jezerezeh , Ishi , Kelek , Talenelat . |	Kelek	Ishi	Jezerezeh	Talenelat						
|He counted off each one , and realized there were only nine here . |										
|One was conspicuously missing . |										
|Why had Shalash 's statue been removed ? |	Shalash									
|King Gavilar was said to be very devout in his Vorin worship . |	Gavilar									
|Too devout , by some people 's standards . |										
|The hallway here curved to the right , running around the perimeter of the domed palace . |										
|They were on the king 's floor , two levels up , surrounded by rock walls , ceiling , and floor . |										
|That was profane . |										
|Stone was not to be trod upon . |										
|But what was he to do ? |	DEFAULT									
|He was Truthless . |	DEFAULT									
|He did as his masters demanded . |	DEFAULT									
|Today , that included wearing white . |										
|Loose white trousers tied at the waist with a rope , and over them a filmy shirt with long sleeves , open at the front . |										
|White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi . |										
|Although Szeth had not asked , his masters had explained why . |	Szeth									
|White to be bold . |										
|White to not blend into the night . |										
|White to give warning . |										
|For if you were going to assassinate a man , he was entitled to see you coming . |	DEFAULT									
|Szeth turned right , taking the hallway directly toward the king 's chambers . |	Szeth									
|Torches burned on the walls , their light unsatisfying to him , a meal of thin broth after a long fast . |	Szeth									
|Tiny flamespren danced around them , like insects made solely of congealed light . |										
|The torches were useless to him . |	DEFAULT									
|He reached for his pouch and the spheres it contained , but then hesitated when he saw more of the blue lights ahead : a pair of Stormlight lamps hanging on the wall , brilliant sapphires glowing at their hearts . |	Szeth									
|Szeth walked up to one of these , holding out his hand to cup it around the glass-shrouded gemstone . |	Szeth									
|`` You there ! '' |	Szeth									
|a voice called in Alethi . |										
|There were two guards at the intersection . |										
|Double guard , for there were savages abroad in Kholinar this night . |										
|True , those savages were supposed to be allies now . |										
|But alliances could be shallow things indeed . |										
|This one would n't last the hour . |										
|Szeth looked as the two guards approached . |	Szeth									
|They carried spears ; they were n't lighteyes , and were therefore forbidden the sword . |										
|Their painted red breastplates were ornate , however , as were their helms . |										
|They might be darkeyed , but they were high-ranking citizens with honored positions in the royal guard . |										
|Stopping a few feet away , the guard at the front gestured with his spear . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Go on , now . |										
|This is no place for you . '' |	DEFAULT									
|He had tan Alethi skin and a thin mustache that ran all the way around his mouth , becoming a beard at the bottom . |	DEFAULT									
|Szeth did n't move . |	Szeth									
|`` Well ? '' |										
|the guard said . |										
|`` What are you waiting for ? '' |	Szeth									
|Szeth breathed in deeply , drawing forth the Stormlight . |	Szeth									
|It streamed into him , siphoned from the twin sapphire lamps on the walls , sucked in as if by his deep inhalation . |	Szeth									
|The Stormlight raged inside of him , and the hallway suddenly grew darker , falling into shade like a hilltop cut off from the sun by a transient cloud . |	Szeth									
|Szeth could feel the Light 's warmth , its fury , like a tempest that had been injected directly into his veins . |	Szeth									
|The power of it was invigorating but dangerous . |										
|It pushed him to act . |	DEFAULT									
|To move . |										
|To strike . |										
|Holding his breath , he clung to the Stormlight . |	DEFAULT									
|He could still feel it leaking out . |										
|Stormlight could be held for only a short time , a few minutes at most . |										
|It leaked away , the human body too porous a container . |										
|He had heard that the Voidbringers could hold it in perfectly . |	DEFAULT									
|But , then , did they even exist ? |										
|His punishment declared that they did n't . |	DEFAULT									
|His honor demanded that they did . |	Szeth									
|Afire with holy energy , Szeth turned to the guards . |	Szeth									
|They could see that he was leaking Stormlight , wisps of it curling from his skin like luminescent smoke . |	Szeth									
|The lead guard squinted , frowning . |										
|Szeth was sure the man had never seen anything like it before . |	Szeth									
|As far as he knew , Szeth had killed every stonewalker who had ever seen what he could do . |	Szeth									
|`` What ... what are you ? '' |	Szeth									
|The guard 's voice had lost its certainty . |										
|`` Spirit or man ? '' |										
|`` What am I ? '' |	Szeth									
|Szeth whispered , a bit of Light leaking from his lips as he looked past the man down the long hallway . |	Szeth
