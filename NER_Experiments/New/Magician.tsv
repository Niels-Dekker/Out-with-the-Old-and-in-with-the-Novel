|The day was unmercifully hot . |										
|The other slaves went about their work , ignoring the sound as much as possible . |										
|Life in the work camp was cheap , and it did no good to dwell on the fate that awaited so many . |										
|The dying man had been bitten by a relli , a snakelike swamp creature . |										
|Its venom was slow-acting and painful ; short of magic , there was no cure . |										
|Suddenly there was silence . |										
|Pug looked over to see a Tsurani guard wipe off his sword . |	Pug	DEFAULT								
|A hand fell on Pug 's shoulder . |	Pug									
|Laurie 's voice whispered in his ear , ` Looks like our venerable overseer was disturbed by the sound of Toffston 's dying . ' |	Laurie	Pug	Toffston							
|Pug tied a coil of rope securely around his waist . |	Pug									
|` At least it ended quickly . ' |										
|He turned to the tall , blond singer from the Kingdom city of Tyr-Sog and said , ` Keep a sharp eye out . |	DEFAULT									
|This one 's old and may be rotten . ' |										
|Without another word . |										
|Pug scampered up the bole of the ngaggi tree , a firiike swamp tree the Tsurani harvested for wood and resins . |	Pug									
|With few metals , the Tsurani had become clever in finding many substitutes . |										
|The wood of this tree could be worked Uke paper , then dried to an incredible hardness , useful in fashioning . |										
|a hundred things . |										
|The resins were used to laminate woods and cure hides . |										
|Properly cured hides could produce a suit of leather armor as tough as Midkemian chain mail , and laminated wooden weapons were nearly the match of Midkemian steel . |										
|Four years in the swamp camp had hardened Pug 's body . |	Pug									
|His sinewy muscles strained as he climbed the tree . |	Pug									
|His skin had been tanned deeply by the harsh sun of the Tsurani homeworld . |	DEFAULT									
|His face was covered by a slave 's beard . |	Pug									
|Pug reached the first large branches and looked down at his friend . |	Pug									
|Laurie stood knee-deep in the murky water , absently swatting at the insects that plagued them while they worked . |	Laurie									
|Pug liked Laurie . |	Pug	Laurie								
|The troubadour had no business being here , but then he had had no business tagging along with a patrol in the hope of seeing Tsurani soldiers , either . |	Laurie									
|He said he had wanted material for ballads that would make him famous throughout the Kingdom . |	DEFAULT									
|He had seen more than he had hoped for . |	DEFAULT									
|The patrol had ridden into a major Tsurani offensive and Laurie had been captured . |	Laurie									
|He had come to this camp over four months ago , and he and Pug had quickly become friends . |	Laurie	Pug								
|Pug continued his climb , keeping one eye always searching for the dangerous tree dwellers of Kelewan . |	Pug									
|Reaching the most likely place for a topping . |										
|Pug froze as he caught a glimpse of movement . |	Pug									
|He relaxed when he saw it was only a needier , a creature whose protection was its resemblance to a clump of ngaggi needles . |	Pug									
|It scurried away from the presence of the human and made the short jump to the branch of a neighboring tree . |										
|Pug made another survey and started tying his ropes . |	Pug									
|His job was to cut away the tops of the huge trees , making the fall less dangerous to those below . |	Pug									
|Pug took several cuts at the bark , then felt the edge of his wooden ax bite into the softer pulp beneath . |	Pug									
|A faint pungent odor greeted his careful sniffing . |	Pug									
|Swearing , he called down to Laurie , ` This one 's rotten . |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|Tell the overseer . ' |										
|He waited , looking out over the tops of trees . |	DEFAULT									
|All around , strange insects and birdlike creatures flew . |										
|In the four years he had been a slave on this world , he had not grown used to the appearance of these life forms . |	DEFAULT									
|They were not all that different from those on Midkemia , but it was the similarities as much as the differences that kept reminding him this was not his home . |	DEFAULT									
|Bees should be yellow-and-black-striped , not bright red . |										
|Eagles should n't have yellow bands on their wings , nor hawks purple . |										
|These creatures were not bees , eagles , or hawks , but the resemblance was striking . |										
|Pug found it easier to accept the stranger creatures of Kelewan than these . |	Pug									
|The six-legged needra , the domesticated beast of burden that looked like some sort of bovine with two extra stumpy legs , or the cho-ja , the insectoid creature who served the Tsurani and could speak their language : these he had come to find familiar . |	Pug									
|But each time he glimpsed a creature from the corner of his eye and turned , expecting it to be Midkemian only to find it was not , then the despair would strike . |	DEFAULT									
|Laurie 's voice brought him from his reverie . |	Laurie	DEFAULT								
|` The overseer comes . ' |										
|Pug swore . |	Pug									
|If the overseer had to get himself dirty by wading in the water , then he would be in a foul mood -- which could mean beatings , or a reduction in the chronically meager food . |	DEFAULT									
|He would already be angered by the delay in the cutting . |	DEFAULT									
|A family of burrowers , beaverlike six - legged creatures , had made themselves at home in the roots of the great trees . |										
|They would gnaw the tender roots and the trees would sicken and die . |										
|The soft , pulpy wood would turn sour , then watery , and after a while the tree would collapse from within . |										
|Several burrower tunnels had been poisoned , but the damage had already been done to the trees . |										
|A rough voice , swearing mightily while its owner splashed through the swamp , announced the arrival of the overseer , Nogamu . |	Nogamu									
|He himself was a slave , but he had attained the highest rank a slave could rise to , and while he could never hope to be free , he had many privileges and could order soldiers or freemen placed under his command . |	Nogamu									
|A young soldier came walking behind , a look of mild amusement on his face . |	DEFAULT									
|He was clean-shaven in the manner of a Tsurani freeman , and as he looked up at Pug , the slave could get a good look at him . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|He had the high cheekbones and nearly black eyes that so many Tsurani possessed . |	DEFAULT									
|His dark eyes caught sight of Pug , and he seemed to nod slightly . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|His blue armor was of a type unknown to Pug , but with the strange Tsurani military organization , that was not surprising . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|Every family , demesne , area , town , city , and province appeared to have its own army . |										
|How they all related one to another within the Empire was beyond Pug 's understanding . |	Pug									
|The overseer stood at the base of the free , his short robe held above the water . |	DEFAULT									
|He growled like the bear he resembled and shouted up at Pug , ` What 's this about another rotten tree ? ' |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|Pug spoke the Tsurani language better than any Midkemian in the camp , for he had been there longer than all but a few old Tsurani slaves . |	Pug									
|He shouted down , ` It smells of rot . |	Pug									
|We should re-rig another and leave this one alone . |										
|Slave Master . ' |										
|The overseer shook his fist . |	DEFAULT									
|` You are all lazy . |										
|There is nothing wrong with this tree . |										
|It is fine . |										
|You only want to keep from working . |	DEFAULT									
|Now cut it ! ' |										
|Pug sighed . |	Pug									
|There was no arguing with the Bear , as all the Midkemian slaves called Nogamu . |	Nogamu									
|He was obviously upset about something , and the slaves would pay the price . |	Nogamu									
|Pug started hacking through the upper section , and it soon fell to the ground . |	Pug									
|The smell of rot was thick , and Pug removed the ropes quickly . |	Pug									
|Just as the last length was coiled around his waist , a splitting sound came from directly in front of him . |	DEFAULT									
|` It falls ! ' |										
|he shouted down to the slaves standing in the water below . |	DEFAULT									
|Without hesitation they all ran . |										
|The cry of ` falls ' was never ignored . |										
|The bole of the tree was splitting down the middle now that the top had been cut away . |										
|While this was not common , if a tree was far enough gone for the pulp to have lost its strength , any flaw in the bark could cause it to split under its own weight . |										
|The tree 's branches would pull the halves away from each other . |										
|Had Pug been tied to the bole , the ropes would have cut him in half before they snapped . |	Pug									
|Pug gauged the direction of the fall , then as the half he stood upon started to move , he launched himself away from it . |	Pug									
|He hit the water flat , back first , trying to let the two feet of water break his fall as much as possible . |	Pug									
|The blow from the water was immediately followed by the harder impact with the ground . |										
|The bottom was mostly mud , so there was little damage done . |										
|The air in his lungs exploded from his mouth when he struck , and his senses reeled for a moment . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He retained enough presence of mind to sit up and gasped a deep lungful of air . |	DEFAULT									
|Suddenly a heavy weight hit him across the stomach , knocking the wind from him and pushing his head back underwater . |	DEFAULT									
|He struggled to move and found a large branch across his stomach . |	DEFAULT									
|He could barely get his face out of the water to get air . |	DEFAULT									
|His lungs burned and he breathed without control . |	DEFAULT									
|Water came pouring down his windpipe , and he started to choke . |	DEFAULT									
|Coughing and sputtering , he tried to keep calm but felt panic rise within him . |	DEFAULT									
|He frantically pushed at the weight across him but could n't move it . |	Pug									
|Abruptly he found his head above water ; Laurie said , ` Spit , Pug ! |	Pug	Laurie								
|Get the muck out of your lungs , or you 'll get lung fever . ' |	Pug									
|Pug coughed and spit . |	Pug									
|With Laurie holding his head , he coutd catch his breath . |	Laurie	Pug								
|Laurie shouted , ` Grab this branch . |	Laurie									
|I 'll pull him out from under . ' |	Laurie									
|Several slaves splashed over , sweat beading their bodies . |										
|They reached underwater and seized the branch . |										
|Heaving , they managed to move it slightly , but Laurie could n't drag Pug out . |	Laurie	Pug								
|` Bring axes ; we 'll have to cut the branch from the tree . ' |										
|Other slaves were starting to bring axes over when Nogamu shouted , ` No . |	Nogamu									
|Leave him . |	DEFAULT									
|We have no time for this . |										
|There are trees to cut . ' |										
|Laurie nearly screamed at him , ` We ca n't leave him ! |	Laurie	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|He 'll drown ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|The overseer crossed over and struck Laurie across the face with a lash . |	Laurie									
|It cut deep into the singer 's cheek , but he did n't let go of his friend 's head . |	Laurie									
|` Back to work , slave . |										
|You 'll be beaten tonight for speaking to me that way . |	DEFAULT									
|There are others who can top . |										
|Now , let him go ! ' |	DEFAULT									
|He struck Laurie again . |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|Laurie winced , but held Pug 's head above water . |	Laurie	Pug								
|Nogamu raised his lash for a third blow , but was halted by a voice from behind . |	Nogamu									
|` Cut the slave from under the branch . ' |										
|Laurie saw the speaker was the young soldier who had accompanied the slave master . |	Laurie									
|The overseer whirled about , unaccustomed to having his orders ques - tioned . |	DEFAULT									
|When he saw who had spoken , he bit back the words that were on his lips . |	DEFAULT									
|Bowing his head , he said , ` My lord 's will . ' |	DEFAULT									
|He signaled for the slaves with the axes to cut Pug loose , and in short order Pug was out from under the branch . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|Laurie carried him over to where the young soldier stood . |	Laurie	Pug								
|Pug coughed the last water from out of his lungs and gasped , ' I thank the master for my life . ' |	Pug									
|The man said nothing , but when the overseer ap - proached , directed his remarks to him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` The slave was right , and you were not . |	DEFAULT									
|The tree was rotten . |										
|It is not proper for you to punish him for your bad judgment and ill-temper . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I should have you beaten , but will not spare the time for it . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The work goes slowly , and my father is displeased . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Nogamu bowed his head . ' |	Nogamu									
|I lose much face in my lord 's sight . |	Nogamu									
|May I have his permission to kill myself ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` No . |										
|It is too much honor . |										
|Return to work . ' |										
|The overseer 's face grew red in silent shame and rage . |	DEFAULT									
|Raising his lash , he pointed at Laurie and Pug . |	DEFAULT	Laurie	Pug							
|` You two , bac to work . ' |										
|Laurie stood , and Pug tried . |	Laurie	Pug								
|His knees were wobbly from his near-drowning , but he managed to stand after a few attempts . |	Pug									
|` These two shall be excused work the rest of the day , ' the young lord said . |	DEFAULT									
|` This one ' -- he pointed to Pug -- ` is of little use . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|The other must dress those cuts you gave him , or festering will start . ' |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|He turned to a guard . |	DEFAULT									
|` Take them back to camp and see to their needs . ' |										
|Pug was grateful , not so much for himself as for Laurie . |	Pug	Laurie								
|With a little rest . |										
|Pug could have returned to work , but an open wound in the swamp was a death warrant as ; 1 often as not . |	Pug									
|Infections came quickly in this hot , dirty || place , and there were few ways of dealing with them . |										
|â€¢ They followed the guard . |										
|As they left . |										
|Pug could see the slave master watching them with naked hatred in his eyes . |	Pug	DEFAULT								
|There was a creaking of floorboards and Pug came instantly awake . |	Pug									
|His slave-bred wariness told him that the sound did n't belong in the hut during the dead of night . |	Pug									
|Through the gloom , footfalls could be heard coming closer , then they stopped at the foot of his pallet . |	DEFAULT									
|From the next pallet , he could hear Laurie 's sharp intake of breath , and he knew the minstrel was awake also . |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|Probably half the slaves had been awakened by the intruder . |										
|The stranger hesitated over something , and Pug waited , tense with uncertainty . |	Pug									
|There was a grunt , and without hesita-B tion . |										
|Pug rolled off his mat . |	Pug									
|A weight came crashing down , || and Pug could hear a dull thud as a dagger struck where his chest had been only moments before . |	Pug									
|Suddenly the room exploded with activity . |										
|Slaves were shouting , and could be heard running for the door . |										
|Pug felt hands reach for him in the dark , and a sharp pain exploded across his chest . |	Pug									
|He reached blindly for his assailant and grappled with him for the blade . |	Pug									
|Another slash , and his right hand was cut across the palm . |	DEFAULT									
|Abruptly the attacker stopped moving , and Pug became aware that a third body was atop the would-be assassin . |	Pug									
|Soldiers rushed into the hut , carrying lanterns , and Pug could see Laurie lying across the still body of Nogamu . |	Pug	Laurie	Nogamu							
|The Bear was still breathing , but from the way the dagger protruded from his ribs , not for long . |										
|The young soldier who had saved Pug 's and Laurie 's lives entered and the others made way for him . |	DEFAULT	Pug	Laurie							
|He stood over the three combatants and simply asked , ` Is he dead ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|The overseer 's eyes opened and in a faint whisper he said , ' I live , lord . |	DEFAULT									
|But I die by the blade . ' |	DEFAULT									
|A weak but defiant smile showed on his sweat-drenched face . |	DEFAULT									
|The young soldier 's expression betrayed no emotion , but his eyes looked as if ablaze . ' |	DEFAULT									
|I think not , ' he said softly . |	DEFAULT									
|He turned to two of the soldiers in the room . |	DEFAULT									
|` Take him outside at once and hang him . |	DEFAULT									
|There will be no honors for his clan to sing . |	DEFAULT									
|Leave the body there for the insects . |										
|It shall be a warning that I am not to be disobeyed . |	DEFAULT									
|Go . ' |										
|The dying man 's face paled , and his lips quivered . |	DEFAULT									
|` No , master . |										
|I pray , leave me to die by the blade . |	DEFAULT									
|A few minutes longer . ' |										
|Bloody foam appeared at the corner of his mouth . |	Nogamu									
|Two husky soldiers reached down for Nogamu and , with little thought for his pain , dragged him outside . |	Nogamu									
|He could be heard wailing the entire way . |	Nogamu									
|The amount of strength left in his voice was amazing , as if his fear of the rope had awakened some deep reserve . |	DEFAULT									
|They stood in frozen tableau until the sound was cut off in a strangled cry . |										
|The young officer then turned to Pug and Laurie . |	DEFAULT	Pug	Laurie							
|Pug sat , blood running from the long , shallow gash across his chest . |	Pug									
|He held his injured hand in the other . |	Pug									
|It was deeply cut , and his fingers would n't move . |	DEFAULT									
|` Bring your wounded friend , ' the young soldier commanded Laurie . |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|Laurie helped Pug to his feet and they followed the officer out of the slave hut . |	Laurie	Pug								
|He led them across the compound to his own quarters and ordered them to enter . |	DEFAULT									
|Once inside , he instructed a guard to send for the camp physician . |	DEFAULT									
|He had them stand in silence until the physician arrived . |	DEFAULT									
|He was an old Tsurani , dressed in the robes of one of their gods , which one the Midkemians could n't tell . |	DEFAULT									
|He inspected Pug 's wounds and judged the chest wound superficial . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|The hand , he said , would be another matter . |	DEFAULT									
|` The cut is deep , and the muscles and tendons have been cut . |										
|It will heal , but there will be a loss of movement and little strength for gripping . |										
|He most likely will be fit for only light duty . ' |	DEFAULT									
|The soldier nodded , a peculiar expression on his face : a mixture of disgust and impatience . |	DEFAULT									
|` Very well . |										
|Dress the wounds , and leave us . ' |										
|The physician set about cleaning the wounds . |										
|He took a score of stitches in the hand , bandaged it , admonished Pug to keep it clean , and left . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|Pug ignored the pain , easing his mind with an old mental exercise . |	Pug									
|After the physician was gone , the soldier studied the two slaves before him . |	DEFAULT									
|` By law , I should have you hung for killing the slave master . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They said nothing . |										
|They would remain silent until commanded to speak . |										
|` But as I hung the slave master , I am free to keep you alive , should it suit my purpose . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I can simply have you punished for wounding him . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|He paused . |	DEFAULT									
|` Consider yourselves punished . ' |										
|With a wave of his hand he said , ` Leave me , but return here at daybreak . |	DEFAULT									
|I have to decide what to do with you . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|They left , feeling fortunate , for under most circum - stances they would now be hanging next to the former slave master . |										
|As they crossed the compound , Laurie said , ' I wonder what that was about ? ' |	Laurie									
|Pug responded , ' I hurt too much to wonder why . |	Pug									
|I 'm just thankful that we will see tomorrow . ' |	Pug									
|Laurie said nothing until they reached the slave hut . ' |	Laurie									
|I think the young lord has something up his sleeve . ' |	Laurie	DEFAULT								
|` Whatever . |										
|I have long since given up trying to understand our masters . |	DEFAULT									
|That 's why I 've stayed alive so long , Laurie . |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|I just do what I 'm told to , and I endure . ' |	Pug									
|Pug pointed to the tree where the former overseer 's body could be seen in the pale moonlight -- only the small moon was out tonight . |	Pug									
|` It 's much too easy to end up like that . ' |										
|Laurie nodded . |	Laurie									
|` Perhaps you 're right . |	DEFAULT									
|I still think about escape . ' |	Pug									
|Pug laughed , a short , bitter sound . |	Pug									
|` Where , singer ? |										
|Where could you run ? |	DEFAULT									
|Toward the rift and ten thousand Tsurani ? ' |										
|Laurie said nothing . |	Laurie									
|They returned to their pallets and tried to sleep in the humid heat . |										
|The young officer sat upon a pile of cushions , Tsurani fashion . |	DEFAULT									
|He sent the guard who had accompanied Pug and Laurie away , then motioned for the two slaves to sit . |	DEFAULT	Pug	Laurie							
|They did so hesitantly , for a slave was not usually permitted to sit in a master 's presence . ' |										
|I am Hokanu , of the Shinzawai . |	Hokanu									
|My father owns this camp , ' he said without preamble . |	Hokanu									
|` He is deeply dissatis - fied with the harvest this year . |	DEFAULT									
|He has sent me to see what can be done . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Now I have no overseer to manage the work , because a foolish man blamed you for his own stupidity . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT	DEFAULT							
|What am I to do ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|They said nothing , for they were not sure if the question was rhetorical . |										
|He asked , ` You have been here , how long ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Pug and Laurie answered in turn . |	Pug	Laurie								
|He considered the answers , then said , ` You ' -- pointing at Laurie -- ` are noth - ing unusual , save you speak our tongue better than most barbarians , all things considered . |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|But you ' -- pointing at Pug -- ` have stayed alive longer than most of your stiff - necked countrymen and also speak our language well . |	Pug									
|You might even pass for a peasant from a remote province . ' |	Pug									
|They sat still , unsure of what Hokanu was leading up to . |	Hokanu									
|Pug realized with a shock that he was probably older by a year or two than this young lord . |	Pug	DEFAULT								
|He was young for such power . |	DEFAULT									
|The ways of the Tsurani were very strange . |										
|In Crydee he would still be an apprentice , or if noble , continuing his education in statecraft . |	DEFAULT									
|` How do you speak so well ? ' |	Pug									
|he asked of Pug . |	DEFAULT	Pug								
|` Master , I was among the first captured and brought here . |	DEFAULT									
|There were only seven of us among so many Tsurani slaves . |										
|We learned to survive . |										
|After some time , I was the only one left . |	DEFAULT									
|The others died of the burning fever or festering wounds , or were killed by the guards . |										
|There were none for me to talk with who spoke my own language . |	DEFAULT									
|No other countryman came to this camp for over a year . ' |										
|The officer nodded , then to Laurie said , ` And you ? ' |	DEFAULT	Laurie								
|` Master , I am a singer , a minstrel in my own land . |	Laurie									
|It is our custom to travel broadly , and we must learn many tongues . |										
|I have also a good ear for music . |	DEFAULT									
|Your language is what is called a tone language on my world ; words with the same sound save for the pitch with which they are spoken have different meanings . |	DEFAULT									
|We have several such tongues to the south of our Kingdom . |										
|I leam quickly . ' |	DEFAULT									
|A glimmering appeared in the eyes of the soldier . |										
|` It is good to know these things . ' |										
|He lapsed deep into thought . |	DEFAULT									
|After a moment he nodded to himself . |	DEFAULT									
|` There are many considerations that fashion a man 's fortune , slaves . ' |										
|He smiled , looking more like a boy than a man . |	DEFAULT									
|` This camp is a shambles . |										
|I am to prepare a report for my father , the Lord of the Shinzawai . |	DEFAULT									
|I think I know what the problems are . ' |	DEFAULT									
|He pointed at Pug . ' |	DEFAULT	Pug
