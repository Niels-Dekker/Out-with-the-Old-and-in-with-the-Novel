|CHAPTER 1 Prince Raoden of Arelon awoke early that morning , completely unaware that he had been damned for all eternity . |	Raoden									
|Still drowsy , Raoden sat up , blinking in the soft morning light . |	Raoden									
|Just outside his open balcony windows he could see the enormous city of Elantris in the distance , its stark walls casting a deep shadow over the smaller city of Kae , where Raoden lived . |	Raoden									
|Elantris 's walls were incredibly high , but Raoden could see the tops of black towers rising behind them , their broken spires a clue to the fallen majesty hidden within . |	Raoden									
|The abandoned city seemed darker than usual . |										
|Raoden stared at it for a moment , then glanced away . |	Raoden									
|The huge Elantrian walls were impossible to ignore , but people of Kae tried very hard to do just that . |										
|It was painful to remember the city 's beauty , to wonder how ten years ago the blessing of the Shaod had become a curse instead ... . |										
|Raoden shook his head , climbing out of bed . |	Raoden									
|It was unusually warm for such an early hour ; he did n't feel even a bit chilly as he threw on his robe , then pulled the servant 's cord beside his bed , indicating that he wanted breakfast . |	Raoden									
|That was another odd thing . |										
|He was hungry -- very hungry . |	DEFAULT									
|Almost ravenous . |										
|He had never liked large breakfasts , but this morning he found himself waiting impatiently for his meal to arrive . |	DEFAULT									
|Finally , he decided to send someone to see what was taking so long . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Ien ? '' |	Ien									
|he called in the unlit chambers . |	DEFAULT									
|There was no response . |										
|Raoden frowned slightly at the Seon 's absence . |	Raoden									
|Where could Ien be ? |	Ien									
|Raoden stood , and as he did , his eyes fell on Elantris again . |	Raoden									
|Resting in the great city 's shadow , Kae seemed like an insignificant village by comparison . |										
|Elantris . |										
|An enormous , ebony block -- not really a city anymore , just the corpse of one . |										
|Raoden shivered slightly . |	Raoden									
|A knock came at his door . |	Raoden									
|`` Finally , '' Raoden said , walking over to pull open the door . |	Raoden									
|Old Elao stood outside with a tray of fruit and warm bread . |	Elao									
|The tray dropped to the ground with a crash , slipping from the stunned maid 's fingers even as Raoden reached out to accept it . |	Raoden	Elao								
|Raoden froze , the tray 's metallic ring echoing through the silent morning hallway . |	Raoden									
|`` Merciful Domi ! '' |	Domi									
|Elao whispered , her eyes horrified and her hand trembling as she reached up to grab the Korathi pendant at her neck . |	Elao									
|Raoden reached out , but the maid took a quivering step away , stumbling on a small melon in her haste to escape . |	Raoden	Elao								
|`` What ? '' |										
|Raoden asked . |	Raoden									
|Then he saw his hand . |	Raoden									
|What had been hidden in the shadows of his darkened room was now illuminated by the hallway 's flickering lantern . |										
|Raoden turned , throwing furniture out of his way as he stumbled to the tall mirror at the side of his chambers . |	Raoden									
|The dawn 's light had grown just strong enough for him to see the reflection that stared back at him . |	Raoden									
|A stranger 's reflection . |	DEFAULT									
|His blue eyes were the same , though they were wide with terror . |	DEFAULT									
|His hair , however , had changed from sandy brown to limp gray . |	DEFAULT									
|The skin was the worst . |										
|The mirrored face was covered with sickly black patches , like dark bruises . |										
|The splotches could mean only one thing . |										
|The Shaod had come upon him . |	DEFAULT									
|The Elantris city gate boomed shut behind him with a shocking sound of finality . |	Raoden									
|Raoden slumped against it , thoughts numbed by the day 's events . |	Raoden									
|It was as if his memories belonged to another person . |	Raoden									
|His father , King Iadon , had n't met Raoden 's gaze as he ordered the priests to prepare his son and throw him into Elantris . |	Raoden	King Iadon								
|It had been done swiftly and quietly ; Iadon could n't afford to let it be known that the crown prince was an Elantrian . |	Iadon									
|Ten years ago , the Shaod would have made Raoden a god . |	Raoden									
|Now , instead of making people into silver-skinned deities , it changed them into sickly monstrosities . |										
|Raoden shook his head in disbelief . |	Raoden									
|The Shaod was a thing that happened to other people -- distant people . |										
|People who deserved to be cursed . |										
|Not the crown prince of Arelon . |	Raoden									
|Not Raoden . |	Raoden									
|The city of Elantris stretched out before him . |	Raoden									
|Its high walls were lined with guardhouses and soldiers -- men intended not to keep enemies out of the city , but to keep its inhabitants from escaping . |										
|Since the Reod , every person taken by the Shaod had been thrown into Elantris to rot ; the fallen city had become an expansive tomb for those whose bodies had forgotten how to die . |										
|Raoden could remember standing on those walls , looking down on Elantris 's dread inhabitants , just as the guards now looked down on him . |	Raoden									
|The city had seemed far away then , even though he had been standing just outside of it . |	Raoden									
|He had wondered , philosophically , what it would be like to walk those blackened streets . |	DEFAULT									
|Now he was going to find out . |	Raoden									
|Raoden pushed against the gate for a moment , as if to force his body through , to cleanse his flesh of its taint . |	Raoden									
|He lowered his head , releasing a quiet moan . |	Raoden									
|He felt like curling into a ball on the grimy stones and waiting until he woke from this dream . |	DEFAULT									
|Except , he knew he would never awaken . |	DEFAULT									
|The priests said that this nightmare would never end . |										
|But , somewhere , something within urged him forward . |	DEFAULT									
|He knew he had to keep moving -- for if he stopped , he feared he 'd simply give up . |	DEFAULT									
|The Shaod had taken his body . |	DEFAULT									
|He could n't let it take his mind as well . |	Raoden									
|So , using his pride like a shield against despair , dejection , and -- most important -- self-pity , Raoden raised his head to stare damnation in the eyes . |	Raoden									
|Before , when Raoden had stood on the walls of Elantris to look down -- both literally and figuratively -- on its inhabitants , he had seen the filth that covered the city . |	Raoden									
|Now he stood in it . |	Raoden									
|Every surface -- from the walls of the buildings to the numerous cracks in the cobblestones -- was coated with a patina of grime . |										
|The slick , oily substance had an equalizing effect on Elantris 's colors , blending them all into a single , depressing hue -- a color that mixed the pessimism of black with the polluted greens and browns of sewage . |										
|Before , Raoden had been able to see a few of the city 's inhabitants . |	Raoden									
|Now he could hear them as well . |	Raoden									
|A dozen or so Elantrians lay scattered across the courtyard 's fetid cobblestones . |										
|Many sat uncaringly , or unknowingly , in pools of dark water , the remains of the night 's rainstorm . |										
|And they were moaning . |										
|Most of them were quiet about it , mumbling to themselves or whimpering with some unseen pain . |										
|One woman at the far end of the courtyard , however , screamed with a sound of raw anguish . |	DEFAULT									
|She fell silent after a moment , her breath or her strength giving out . |	DEFAULT									
|Most of them wore what looked like rags -- dark , loose-fitting garments that were as soiled as the streets . |										
|Looking closely , however , Raoden recognized the clothing . |	Raoden									
|He glanced down at his own white burial cloths . |	Raoden									
|They were long and flowing , like ribbons sewn together into a loose robe . |										
|The linen on his arms and legs was already stained with grime from brushing up against the city gate and stone pillars . |	Raoden									
|Raoden suspected they would soon be indistinguishable from the other Elantrians ' garb . |	Raoden									
|This is what I will become , Raoden thought . |	Raoden									
|It has already begun . |										
|In a few weeks I will be nothing more than a dejected body , a corpse whimpering in the corner . |	Raoden									
|A slight motion on the other side of the courtyard brought Raoden out of his self-pity . |	Raoden									
|Some Elantrians were crouching in a shadowed doorway across from him . |	Raoden									
|He could n't make out much from their silhouetted forms , but they seemed to be waiting for something . |	DEFAULT									
|He could feel their eyes on him . |	Raoden									
|Raoden raised an arm to shade his eyes , and only then did he remember the small thatch basket in his hands . |	Raoden									
|It held the ritual Korathi sacrifice sent with the dead into the next life -- or , in this case , into Elantris . |										
|The basket contained a loaf of bread , a few thin vegetables , a handful of grain , and a small flask of wine . |										
|Normal death sacrifices were far more extensive , but even a victim of the Shaod had to be given something . |										
|Raoden glanced back at the figures in the doorway , his mind flashing to rumors he 'd heard on the outside -- stories of Elantrian brutality . |	Raoden									
|The shadowed figures had yet to move , but their study of him was unnerving . |	Raoden									
|Taking a deep breath , Raoden took a step to the side , moving along the city wall toward the east side of the courtyard . |	Raoden									
|The forms still seemed to be watching him , but they did n't follow . |	Raoden									
|In a moment , he could no longer see through the doorway , and a second later he had safely passed into one of the side streets . |	Raoden									
|Raoden released his breath , feeling that he had escaped something , though he did n't know what . |	Raoden									
|After a few moments , he was certain that no one followed , and he began to feel foolish for his alarm . |	Raoden									
|So far , he had yet to see anything that corroborated the rumors about Elantris . |	Raoden									
|Raoden shook his head and continued moving . |	Raoden									
|The stench was almost overwhelming . |										
|The omnipresent sludge had a musty , rotten scent , like that of dying fungus . |										
|Raoden was so bothered by the smell that he nearly stepped directly on the gnarled form of an old man huddled next to a building 's wall . |	Raoden									
|The man moaned piteously , reaching up with a thin arm . |	DEFAULT									
|Raoden looked down , and felt a sudden chill . |	Raoden									
|The `` old man '' was no more than sixteen years old . |	DEFAULT									
|The creature 's soot-covered skin was dark and spotted , but his face was that of a child , not a man . |										
|Raoden took an involuntary step backward . |	Raoden									
|The boy , as if realizing that his chance would soon pass , stretched his arm forward with the sudden strength of desperation . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Food ? '' |										
|he mumbled through a mouth only half full of teeth . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Please ? '' |										
|Then the arm fell , its endurance expended , and the body slumped back against the cold stone wall . |										
|His eyes , however , continued to watch Raoden . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|Sorrowful , pained eyes . |										
|Raoden had seen beggars before in the Outer Cities , and he had probably been fooled by charlatans a number of times . |	Raoden									
|This boy , however , was not faking . |	DEFAULT									
|Raoden reached up and pulled the loaf of bread from his sacrificial offerings , then handed it to the boy . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|The look of disbelief that ran across the boy 's face was somehow more disturbing than the despair it had replaced . |	DEFAULT									
|This creature had given up hope long ago ; he probably begged out of habit rather than expectation . |	DEFAULT									
|Raoden left the boy behind , turning to continue down the small street . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|He had hoped that the city would grow less gruesome as he left the main courtyard -- thinking , perhaps , that the dirt was a result of the area 's relatively frequent use . |	Raoden									
|He had been wrong ; the alley was covered with just as much filth as the courtyard , if not more . |	DEFAULT									
|A muffled thump sounded from behind . |										
|Raoden turned with surprise . |	Raoden									
|A group of dark forms stood near the mouth of the side street , huddled around an object on the ground . |										
|The beggar . |	DEFAULT									
|Raoden watched with a shiver as five men devoured his loaf of bread , fighting among themselves and ignoring the boy 's despairing cries . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|Eventually , one of the newcomers -- obviously annoyed -- brought a makeshift club down on the boy 's head with a crunch that resounded through the small alley . |	DEFAULT									
|The men finished the bread , then turned to regard Raoden . |	Raoden									
|He took an apprehensive step backward ; it appeared that he had been hasty in assuming he had n't been followed . |	Raoden									
|The five men slowly stalked forward , and Raoden spun , taking off at a run . |	Raoden									
|Sounds of pursuit came from behind . |										
|Raoden scrambled away in fear -- something that , as a prince , he had never needed to do before . |	Raoden									
|He ran madly , expecting his breath to run short and a pain to stab him in the side , as usually happened when he overextended himself . |	Raoden									
|Neither occurred . |										
|Instead , he simply began to feel horribly tired , weak to the point that he knew he would soon collapse . |	DEFAULT									
|It was a harrowing feeling , as if his life were slowly seeping away . |	Raoden									
|Desperate , Raoden tossed the sacrificial basket over his head . |	Raoden									
|The awkward motion threw him off balance , and an unseen schism in the cobblestones sent him into a maladroit skip that did n't end until he collided with a rotting mass of wood . |	Raoden									
|The wood -- which might once have been a pile of crates -- squished , breaking his fall . |	Raoden									
|Raoden sat up quickly , the motion tossing shreds of wood pulp across the damp alleyway . |	Raoden									
|His assailants , however , were no longer concerned with him . |	Raoden									
|The five men crouched in the street 's muck , picking scattered vegetables and grain off the cobblestones and out of the dark pools . |										
|Raoden felt his stomach churn as one of the men slid his finger down a crack , scraped up a dark handful that was more sludge than corn , then rammed the entire mass between eager lips . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|Brackish spittle dribbled down the man 's chin , dropping from a mouth that resembled a mud-filled pot boiling on the stove . |	DEFAULT									
|One man saw Raoden watching . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|The creature growled , reaching down to grab the almost-forgotten cudgel at his side . |										
|Raoden searched frantically for a weapon , finding a length of wood that was slightly less rotten than the rest . |	Raoden									
|He held the weapon in uncertain hands , trying to project an air of danger . |	Raoden									
|The thug paused . |	DEFAULT									
|A second later , a cry of joy from behind drew his attention : one of the others had located the tiny skin of wine . |	Raoden									
|The struggle that ensued apparently drove all thoughts of Raoden from the men 's minds , and the five were soon gone -- four chasing after the one who had been fortunate , or foolish , enough to escape with the precious liquor . |	Raoden									
|Raoden sat in the debris , overwhelmed . |	Raoden									
|This is what you will become ... . |	Raoden									
|`` Looks like they forgot about you , sule , '' a voice observed . |	Raoden									
|Raoden jumped , looking toward the sound of the voice . |	Raoden									
|A man , his smooth bald head reflecting the morning light , reclined lazily on a set of steps a short distance away . |	DEFAULT									
|He was definitely an Elantrian , but before the transformation he must have been of a different race -- not from Arelon , like Raoden . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|The man 's skin bore the telltale black splotches of the Shaod , but the unaffected patches were n't pale , they were a deep brown instead . |	DEFAULT									
|Raoden tensed against possible danger , but this man showed no signs of the primal wildness or the decrepit weakness Raoden had seen in the others . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|Tall and firm-framed , the man had wide hands and keen eyes set in a dark-skinned face . |										
|He studied Raoden with a thoughtful attitude . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|Raoden breathed a sigh of relief . |	Raoden									
|`` Whoever you are , I 'm glad to see you . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|I was beginning to think everyone in here was either dying or insane . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` We ca n't be dying , '' the man responded with a snort . |	DEFAULT									
|`` We 're already dead . |										
|Kolo ? '' |										
|`` Kolo . '' |										
|The foreign word was vaguely familiar , as was the man 's strong accent . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You 're not from Arelon ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|The man shook his head . |	Galladon									
|`` I 'm Galladon , from the sovereign realm of Duladel . |	Galladon									
|I 'm most recently from Elantris , land of sludge , insanity , and eternal perdition . |	Galladon									
|Nice to meet you . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Duladel ? '' |										
|Raoden said . |	Raoden									
|`` But the Shaod only affects people from Arelon . '' |										
|He picked himself up , brushing away pieces of wood in various stages of decomposition , grimacing at the pain in his stubbed toe . |	DEFAULT									
|He was covered with slime , and the raw stench of Elantris now rose from him as well . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Duladel is of mixed blood , sule . |	Duladen									
|Arelish , Fjordell , Teoish -- you 'll find them all . |	Raoden									
|I -- '' Raoden cursed quietly , interrupting the man . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|Galladon raised an eyebrow . |	Galladon									
|`` What is it , sule ? |										
|Get a splinter in the wrong place ? |										
|There are n't many right places for that , I suppose . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` It 's my toe ! '' |	Raoden									
|Raoden said , limping across the slippery cobblestones . |	Raoden									
|`` There 's something wrong with it -- I stubbed it when I fell , but the pain is n't going away . '' |	Raoden									
|Galladon shook his head ruefully . |	Galladon									
|`` Welcome to Elantris , sule . |										
|You 're dead -- your body wo n't repair itself like it should . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` What ? '' |										
|Raoden flopped to the ground next to Galladon 's steps . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|His toe continued to hurt with a pain as sharp as the moment he stubbed it . |	Raoden									
|`` Every pain , sule , '' Galladon whispered . |	Galladon									
|`` Every cut , every nick , every bruise , and every ache -- they will stay with you until you go mad from the suffering . |										
|As I said , welcome to Elantris . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` How do you stand it ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Raoden asked , massaging his toe , an action that did n't help . |	Raoden									
|It was such a silly little injury , but he had to fight to keep the pained tears from his eyes . |	Raoden									
|`` We do n't . |										
|We 're either very careful , or we end up like those rulos you saw in the courtyard . '' |										
|`` In the courtyard ... . |										
|Idos Domi ! '' |										
|Raoden pulled himself to his feet and hobbled toward the courtyard . |	Raoden									
|He found the beggar boy in the same location , near the mouth of the alley . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|He was still alive ... in a way . |	DEFAULT									
|The boy 's eyes stared blankly into the air , the pupils quivering . |	DEFAULT									
|His lips worked silently , no sound escaping . |	DEFAULT									
|The boy 's neck had been completely crushed , and there was a massive gash in its side , exposing the vertebrae and throat . |	DEFAULT									
|The boy tried without success to breathe through the mess . |	DEFAULT									
|Suddenly Raoden 's toe did n't seem so bad . |	Raoden									
|`` Idos Domi ... '' Raoden whispered , turning his head as his stomach lurched . |	Raoden									
|He reached out and grabbed the side of a building to steady himself , his head bowed , as he tried to keep from adding to the sludge on the cobblestones . |	Raoden									
|`` There is n't much left for this one , '' Galladon said with a matter-of-fact tone , crouching down next to the beggar . |	Galladon	DEFAULT								
|`` How ... ? '' |										
|Raoden began , then stopped as his stomach threatened him again . |	Raoden									
|He sat down in the slime with a plop and , after a few deep breaths , continued . |	Raoden									
|`` How long will he live like that ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` You still do n't understand , sule , '' Galladon said , his accented voice sorrowful . |	Galladon	DEFAULT								
|`` He is n't alive -- none of us are . |	DEFAULT									
|That 's why we 're here . |										
|Kolo ? |										
|The boy will stay like this forever . |										
|That is , after all , the typical length of eternal damnation . '' |										
|`` Is there nothing we can do ? '' |										
|Galladon shrugged . |	Galladon									
|`` We could try burning him , assuming we could make a fire . |	DEFAULT									
|Elantrian bodies seem to burn better than those of regular people , and some think that 's a fitting death for our kind . '' |										
|`` And ... '' Raoden said , still unable to look at the boy . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|`` And if we do that , what happens to him -- his soul ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` He does n't have a soul , '' Galladon said . |	DEFAULT	Galladon								
|`` Or so the priests tell us . |										
|Korathi , Derethi , Jesker -- they all say the same thing . |	Korathi	Derethi	Jesker							
|We 're damned . '' |										
|`` That does n't answer my question . |	DEFAULT									
|Will the pain stop if he is burned ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Galladon looked down at the boy . |	Galladon	DEFAULT								
|Eventually , he just shrugged . |	Galladon									
|`` Some say that if you burn us , or cut off our head , or do anything that completely destroys the body , we 'll just stop existing . |										
|Others , they say the pain goes on -- that we become pain . |										
|They think we 'd float thoughtlessly , unable to feel anything but agony . |										
|I do n't like either option , so I just try to keep myself in one piece . |	DEFAULT									
|Kolo ? '' |										
|`` Yes , '' Raoden whispered . |	Raoden									
|`` I kolo . '' |	DEFAULT									
|He turned , finally getting the courage to look back at the wounded boy . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The enormous gash stared back at him . |	DEFAULT									
|Blood seeped slowly from the wound -- as if the liquid were just sitting in the veins , like stagnant water in a pool . |										
|With a sudden chill Raoden reached up and felt his chest . |	Raoden									
|`` I do n't have a heartbeat , '' he realized for the first time . |	Raoden									
|Galladon looked at Raoden as if he had made an utterly idiotic statement . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|`` Sule , you 're dead . |	Raoden									
|Kolo ? '' |										
|_______ They did n't burn the boy . |	DEFAULT									
|Not only did they lack the proper implements to make fire , but Galladon forbade it . |	Galladon									
|`` We ca n't make a decision like that . |										
|What if he really has no soul ? |	DEFAULT									
|What if he stopped existing when we burned his body ? |	DEFAULT									
|To many , an existence of agony is better than no existence at all . '' |										
|So , they left the boy where he had fallen -- Galladon doing so without a second thought , Raoden following because he could n't think of anything else to do , though he felt the pain of guilt more sharply than even the pain in his toe . |	Raoden	Galladon	DEFAULT							
|Galladon obviously did n't care whether Raoden followed him , went in another direction , or stood staring at an interesting spot of grime on the wall . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|The large , dark-skinned man walked back the way they had come , passing the occasional moaning body in a gutter , his back turned toward Raoden with a posture of complete indifference . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|Watching the Dula go , Raoden tried to gather his thoughts . |	Raoden									
|He had been trained for a life in politics ; years of preparation had conditioned him to make quick decisions . |	Raoden									
|He made one just then . |	DEFAULT									
|He decided to trust Galladon . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|There was something innately likable about the Dula , something Raoden found indefinably appealing , even if it was covered by a grime of pessimism as thick as the slime on the ground . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|It was more than Galladon 's lucidity , more than just his leisurely attitude . |	Galladon									
|Raoden had seen the man 's eyes when he regarded the suffering child . |	Raoden	Galladon	DEFAULT							
|Galladon claimed to accept the inevitable , but he felt sad that he had to do so . |	Galladon									
|The Dula found his former perch on the steps and settled back down . |	Galladon									
|Taking a determined breath , Raoden walked over and stood expectantly in front of the man . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|Galladon glanced up . |	Galladon									
|`` What ? '' |										
|`` I need your help , Galladon , '' Raoden said , squatting on the ground in front of the steps . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|Galladon snorted . |	Galladon									
|`` This is Elantris , sule . |										
|There 's no such thing as help . |										
|Pain , insanity , and a whole lot of slime are the only things you 'll find here . '' |										
|`` You almost sound like you believe that . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` You are asking in the wrong place , sule . '' |	Raoden									
|`` You 're the only noncomatose person I 've met in here who has n't attacked me , '' Raoden said . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|`` Your actions speak much more convincingly than your words . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Perhaps I simply have n't tried to hurt you because I know you do n't have anything to take . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` I do n't believe that . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Galladon shrugged an `` I do n't care what you believe '' shrug and turned away , leaning back against the side of the building and closing his eyes . |	Galladon	DEFAULT								
|`` Are you hungry , Galladon ? '' |	Galladon									
|Raoden asked quietly . |	Raoden									
|The man 's eyes snapped open . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I used to wonder when King Iadon fed the Elantrians , '' Raoden mused . |	King Iadon									
|`` I never heard of any supplies entering the city , but I always assumed that they were sent . |	Raoden									
|After all , I thought , the Elantrians stay alive . |	DEFAULT									
|I never understood . |	DEFAULT									
|If the people of this city can exist without heartbeats , then they can probably exist without food . |										
|Of course , that does n't mean the hunger goes away . |										
|I was ravenous when I awoke this morning , and I still am . |	DEFAULT									
|From the looks in the eyes of those men who attacked me , I 'd guess the hunger only gets worse . '' |	Raoden									
|Raoden reached under his grime-stained sacrificial robe , pulling out a thin object and holding it up for Galladon to see . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|A piece of dried meat . |										
|Galladon 's eyes opened all the way , his face changing from bored to interested . |	Galladon									
|There was a glint in his eyes -- a bit of the same wildness that Raoden had seen in the savage men earlier . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|It was more controlled , but it was there . |										
|For the first time , Raoden realized just how much he was gambling on his first impression of the Dula . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|`` Where did that come from ? '' |										
|Galladon asked slowly . |	Galladon									
|`` It fell out of my basket when the priests were leading me here , so I stuffed it under my sash . |	Galladon									
|Do you want it or not ? '' |	Galladon									
|Galladon did n't answer for a moment . |	Galladon									
|`` What makes you think I wo n't simply attack you and take it ? '' |	Raoden	Galladon								
|The words were not hypothetical ; Raoden could tell that a part of Galladon was actually considering such an action . |	Raoden	Galladon								
|How large a part was still indeterminable . |										
|`` You called me ` sule , ' Galladon . |	Galladon	DEFAULT								
|How could you kill one you 've dubbed a friend ? '' |	Galladon									
|Galladon sat , transfixed by the tiny piece of meat . |	Galladon									
|A thin drop of spittle ran unnoticed from the side of his mouth . |	Galladon									
|He looked up at Raoden , who was growing increasingly anxious . |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|When their eyes met , something sparked in Galladon , and the tension snapped . |	Galladon									
|The Dula suddenly bellowed a deep , resounding laugh . |	Galladon									
|`` You speak Duladen , sule ? '' |	Raoden									
|`` Only a few words , '' Raoden said modestly . |	Raoden									
|`` An educated man ? |										
|Rich offerings for Elantris today ! |										
|All right , you conniving rulo , what do you want ? '' |	Raoden									
|`` Thirty days , '' Raoden said . |	Raoden									
|`` For thirty days you will show me around and tell me what you know . '' |	Raoden	DEFAULT								
|`` Thirty days ? |										
|Sule , you 're kayana . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` The way I see it , '' Raoden said , moving to tuck the meat back in his sash , `` the only food that ever enters this place arrives with the newcomers . |	Raoden									
|One must get pretty hungry with so few offerings and so many mouths to feed . |										
|One would think the hunger would be almost maddening . '' |
