|We must blame ourselves for misinterpreting them . |										
|One-Eye 's handicap in no way impairs his marvelous hindsight . |	One-Eye									
|Lightning from a clear sky smote the Necropolitan Hill . |										
|One bolt struck the bronze plaque sealing the tomb of the forvalaka , obliterating half the spell of confinement . |										
|It rained stones . |										
|Statues bled . |										
|Priests at several temples reported sacrificial victims without hearts or livers . |										
|One victim escaped after its bowels were opened and was not recaptured . |										
|At the Fork Barracks , where the Urban Cohorts were billeted , the image of Teux turned completely around . |										
|For nine evenings running , ten black vultures circled the Bastion . |										
|Then one evicted , the eagle which lived atop the Paper Tower . |										
|Astrologers refused readings , fearing for their lives . |										
|A mad soothsayer wandered the streets proclaiming the imminent end of the world . |										
|At the Bastion , the eagle not only ; departed , the ivy on the outer ramparts withered and gave way to a creeper which appeared black in all but the most intense sunlight . |										
|But that happens every year . |										
|Fools can make an omen of anything in retrospect . |										
|We should have been better prepared . |										
|We did have four modestly accomplished wizards to stand sentinel against predatory tomorrows-though never by any means as sophisticated as divining through sheeps ' entrails . |										
|Still , the best augurs are those who divine from the portents of the past . |										
|They compile phenomenal records . |										
|Beryl totters perpetually , ready to stumble over a precipice into chaos . |										
|The Queen of the Jewel Cities was old and decadent and mad , filled with the stench of degeneracy and moral dryrot . |										
|Only a fool would be surprised by anything found creeping its night streets . |										
|I had every shutter thrown wide , praying for a breath off the harbor , rotting fish and all . |	DEFAULT									
|There was n't enough breeze to stir a cobweb . |										
|I mopped my face and grimaced at my first patient . |	DEFAULT	Curly								
|`` Crabs again , Curly ? '' |	Curly									
|He grinned feebly . |	DEFAULT									
|His face was pale . |	DEFAULT									
|`` It 's my stomach , Croaker , '' His pate looks like a polished ostrich egg . |	DEFAULT	Croaker								
|Thus the name . |										
|I checked the watch schedule and duty roster . |	DEFAULT									
|Nothing there he would want to avoid . |	DEFAULT									
|`` It 's bad , Croaker . |	Croaker									
|Really . '' |										
|`` Uhm . '' |										
|I assumed my professional demeanor , sure what it was . |	DEFAULT									
|His skin was clammy , despite the heat . |	Curly									
|`` Eaten outside the commissary lately , Curly ? '' |	Curly									
|A fly landed on his head , strutted like a conqueror . |	Curly									
|He did n't notice . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Yeah . |										
|Three , four times . '' |										
|`` Uhm . '' |										
|I mixed a nasty , milky concoction . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Drink this . |										
|All of it . '' |										
|His whole face puckered at the first taste . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Look , Croaker , I. ... '' The smell of the stuff revolted me . |	Croaker	DEFAULT								
|`` Drink , friend . |										
|Two men died before I came up with that . |	DEFAULT									
|Then Pokey took it and lived . '' |	Pokey									
|Word was out about that . |										
|He drank . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You mean it 's poison ? |	DEFAULT									
|The damned Blues slipped me something ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Take it easy . |										
|You 'll be okay . |	DEFAULT									
|Yeah . |										
|It looks that way . '' |										
|I 'd had to open up Walleye and Wild Bruce to learn the truth . |	Walleye	Wild Bruce								
|It was a subtle poison . |										
|`` Get over there on the cot where the breeze will hit you-if the son of a bitch ever comes up . |	DEFAULT									
|And lie still . |										
|Let the stuff work . '' |										
|I settled him down , `` Tell me what you ate outside . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I collected a pen and a chart tacked onto a board . |	DEFAULT									
|I had done the same with Pokey , and with Wild Bruce before he died , and had had Walleye 's platoon sergeant backtrack his movements . |	DEFAULT	Pokey	Wild Bruce	Walleye						
|I was sure the poison had come from one of several nearby dives frequented by the Bastion garrison . |	DEFAULT									
|Curly produced one across-the-board match . |	Curly									
|`` Bingo ! |										
|We 've got the bastards now . '' |										
|`` Who ? '' |										
|He was ready to go settle up himself . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You rest . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'll see the Captain . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I patted his shoulder , checked the next room . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Curly was it for morning sick call . |	Curly									
|I took the long route , along Trejan 's Wall , which overlooks Beryl 's harbor . |	DEFAULT									
|Halfway oven I paused , stared north , past the mole and lighthouse and Fortress Island , at the Sea of Torments . |	DEFAULT									
|Particolored sails speckled the dingy grey-brown water as coastal dhows scooted out along the spiderweb of routes linking the Jewel Cities . |										
|The upper air was still and heavy and hazy . |										
|The horizon could not be discerned . |										
|But down on the water the air was in motion . |										
|There was always a breeze out around the Island , though it avoided the shore as if fearing leprosy . |										
|Closer at hand , the wheeling gulls were as surly and lackadaisical as the day promised to make most men . |										
|Another summer in service to the Syndic of Beryl , sweating and grimy , thanklessly shielding him from political rivals and his undisciplined native troops . |	Beryl									
|Another summer busting our butts for Curly 's reward . |	Curly									
|The pay was good , but not in coin of the soul . |										
|Our forebrethren would be embarrassed to see us so diminished . |										
|Beryl is misery curdled , but also ancient and intriguing . |										
|Its history is a bottomless well filled with murky water . |										
|I amuse myself plumbing its shadowy depths , trying to isolate fact from fiction , legend , and myth . |	DEFAULT									
|No easy task , for the city 's earlier historians wrote with an eye to pleasing the powers of their day . |										
|The most interesting period , for me , is the ancient kingdom , which is the least satisfactorily chronicled . |	DEFAULT									
|It was then , in the reign of Niam , that the forvalaka came , were overcome after a decade of terror , and were confined in their dark tomb atop the Necropolitan Hill . |										
|Echoes of that terror persist in folklore and matronly admonitions to unruly children . |										
|No one recalls what the forvalaka were , now . |										
|I resumed walking , despairing of beating the heat . |	DEFAULT									
|The sentries , in their shaded kiosks , wore towels draped around their necks . |										
|A breeze startled me . |	DEFAULT									
|I faced the harbor . |	DEFAULT									
|A ship was founding the Island , a great lumbering beast that dwarfed the dhows and feluccas . |										
|A silver skull bulged in the center of its full-bellied black sail . |										
|That skull 's red eyes glowed . |										
|Fires flickered behind its broken teeth . |										
|A glittering silver band encircled the skull . |										
|`` What the hell is that ? '' |										
|a sentry asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I do n't know , Whitey . '' |	DEFAULT	Whitey								
|The ship 's size impressed me more than did its flashy sail . |	DEFAULT									
|The four minor wizards we had with the Company could match that showmanship . |										
|But I 'd never seen a galley sporting five banks of oars . |	DEFAULT									
|I recalled my mission . |	DEFAULT									
|I knocked on the Captain 's door . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|He did not respond . |	DEFAULT									
|I invited myself inside , found him snoring in his big wooden chair . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Yo ! '' |										
|I hollered . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Fire ! |										
|Riots in the Groan ! |										
|Dancing at the Gate of Dawn ! '' |	Dancing									
|Dancing was an old time general who nearly destroyed Beryl . |	Dancing									
|People still shudder at his name . |	Dancing									
|The Captain was cool . |	DEFAULT									
|He did n't crack an eyelid or smile . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You 're presumptuous , Croaker , When are you going to learn to go through channels ? '' |	Croaker									
|Channels meant bug the Lieutenant first . |	DEFAULT									
|Do n't interrupt his nap unless the Blues were storming the Bastion . |	DEFAULT									
|I explained about Curly and my chart . |	DEFAULT	Curly								
|He swung his feet off the desk . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Sounds like work for Mercy . '' |	Mercy									
|His voice had a hard edge . |	DEFAULT									
|The Black Company does not suffer malicious attacks upon its men . |										
|Mercy was our nastiest platoon leader . |	Mercy									
|He thought a dozen men would suffice , but lei Silent and me lag along . |	Mercy	Silent	DEFAULT							
|I could patch the wounded . |	DEFAULT									
|Silent would be useful if the Blues played rough . |	Silent									
|Silent held us up half a day while he made a quick trip to the woods , `` What the hell you up to ? '' |	Silent									
|I asked when he got back , lugging a ratty-looking sack . |	DEFAULT	Silent								
|He just grinned . |	Silent									
|Silent he is and silent he stays . |	DEFAULT									
|The place was called Mole Tavern . |										
|It was a comfortable hangout . |										
|I had passed many an evening there . |	DEFAULT									
|Mercy assigned three men to the back door , and a pair each to the two windows . |	Mercy									
|He sent another two to the roof . |	Mercy									
|Every building in Beryl has a roof hatch . |										
|People sleep up top during the summer . |										
|He led the rest of us through the Mole 's front door . |	Mercy									
|Mercy was a smallish , cocky fellow , fond of the dramatic gesture . |	Mercy									
|His entry should have been preceded by fanfares . |	Mercy									
|The crowd froze , stared at our shields and bared blades , at snatches of grim faces barely visible through gaps in our face guards . |										
|`` Verus ! '' |	Verus									
|Mercy shouted . |	Mercy									
|`` Get your butt out here ! '' |										
|The grandfather of the managing family appeared . |										
|He sidled toward us like a mutt expecting a kick . |	DEFAULT									
|The customers began buzzing . |										
|`` Silence ! '' |										
|Mercy thundered . |	Mercy									
|He could get a big roar out of his small body . |	Mercy									
|`` How may we help you , honored sirs ? '' |										
|the old man asked . |	DEFAULT									
|`` You can get your sons and grandsons out here , Blue . '' |	Blue									
|Chairs squeaked . |										
|A soldier slammed his blade into a tabletop . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Sit still , '' Mercy said . |	Mercy									
|`` You 're just having lunch , fine . |	DEFAULT									
|You 'll be loose in an hour . '' |	DEFAULT									
|The old man began shaking . |	DEFAULT									
|`` I do n't understand , sir . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|What have we done ? '' |										
|Mercy grinned evilly . |	Mercy									
|`` He plays the innocent well . |	DEFAULT									
|It 's murder , Verus . |	Verus									
|Two charges of murder by poisoning . |										
|Two of attempted murder by poisoning . |										
|The magistrates decreed the punishment of slaves . '' |										
|He was having fun . |	Mercy									
|Mercy was n't one of my favorite people . |	Mercy	DEFAULT								
|He never slopped being the boy who pulled wings off flies . |	Mercy									
|The punishment of slaves meant being left up for scavenger birds after public crucifixion . |										
|In Beryl only criminals are buried uncremated , or not buried al all . |										
|An uproar rose in the kitchen . |										
|Somebody was trying to get out the back door . |										
|Our men were objecting . |										
|The public room exploded . |										
|A wave of dagger-brandishing humanity hit us . |										
|They forced us back to the door . |										
|Those who were not guilty obviously feared they would be condemned with those who were . |										
|Beryl 's justice is fast , crude , and harsh , and seldom gives a defendant opportunity to clear himself . |	Beryl									
|A dagger slipped past a shield . |										
|One of our men went down , I am not much as a fighter , but I stepped into his place . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Mercy said something snide that I did not catch . |	Mercy	DEFAULT								
|`` That 's your chance at heaven wasted , '' I countered . |	Mercy	DEFAULT								
|`` You 're out of the Annals forever . '' |	DEFAULT									
|`` Crap . |										
|You do n't leave out anything . '' |	DEFAULT									
|A dozen citizens went down . |										
|Blood pooled in low places on the floor . |										
|Spectators gathered outside . |										
|Soon some adventurer would hit us from behind . |										
|A dagger nicked Mercy . |	Mercy									
|He lost patience . |	Mercy									
|`` Silent ! '' |	Silent									
|Silent was on the job already , but he was Silent . |	Silent									
|That meant no sound , and very little flash or fury . |										
|Mole patrons began slapping their faces and pawing the air , forsaking us . |										
|They hopped and danced , grabbed their backs and behinds , squealed and howled piteously . |										
|Several collapsed . |										
|`` What the hell did you do ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|I asked . |	DEFAULT									
|Silent grinned , exposing sharp teeth . |										
|He passed a dusky paw across my eyes . |	Silent	DEFAULT								
|I saw the . |	DEFAULT									
|Mole tram a slightly altered perspective . |										
|The bag he had lugged in from out of town proved to be one of those hornets ' nests you can , if you 're unlucky , run into in the woods south of Beryl . |	DEFAULT									
|Its tenants were the bumblebee-looking monsters peasants call bald-faced hornets . |										
|They have a foul temper unrivalled anywhere in Nature . |										
|They cowed the Mole crowd fast , without bothering our lads . |										
|`` Fine work , Silent , '' Mercy said , after having vented his fury on several hapless patrons . |	Silent	Mercy								
|He herded the survivors into the street . |	Mercy									
|I examined our injured brother while the unharmed soldier finished the wounded . |	DEFAULT									
|Saving the Syndic the cost of a trial and a hangman , Mercy called that . |	Mercy									
|Silent looked on , still grinning . |										
|He 's not nice either , though he seldom participates directly . |	Silent									
|We took more prisoners than expected . |										
|`` Was a bunch of them . '' |										
|Mercy 's eyes twinkled . |	Mercy									
|`` Thanks , Silent . '' |	Silent									
|The line stretched a block . |										
|Fate is a fickle bitch . |										
|She 'd led us to Mole Tavern at a critical moment . |	DEFAULT									
|Poking around , our witch man had unearthed a prize , a crowd concealed in a hideout beneath the wine cellar . |										
|Among them were some of the best known Blues . |										
|Mercy chattered , wondering aloud how large a reward our informant deserved . |	Mercy									
|No such informant existed . |										
|The yammer was meant to save our tame wizards from becoming prime targets . |										
|Our enemies would scurry around looking for phantom spies . |										
|`` Move them out , '' Mercy ordered . |	Mercy									
|Still grinning , he eyed the sullen crowd . |	Mercy									
|`` Think they 'll try something ? '' |										
|They did not . |										
|His supreme confidence cowed anyone who had ideas . |	DEFAULT									
|We wound through mazelike streets half as old as the world , our prisoners shuffling listlessly . |										
|I gawked . |	DEFAULT									
|My comrades are indifferent to the past , but I can not help being awed-and occasionally intimidated-by how time-deep Beryl 's history runs . |	DEFAULT									
|Mercy called an unexpected halt . |	Mercy									
|We had come to the Avenue of the Syndics ' , which winds from the Customs House uptown to the Bastion 's main gate . |										
|There was a procession on the Avenue . |										
|Though we reached the intersection first , Mercy yielded the right-of-way . |	Mercy									
|The procession consisted of a hundred armed men . |										
|They looked tougher than anyone in Beryl but us . |										
|At their head rode a dark figure on the biggest black stallion I 've ever seen . |	DEFAULT									
|The rider was small , effeminately slim , and clad in worn black leather . |	DEFAULT									
|He wore a black morion which concealed his head entirely . |	DEFAULT									
|Black gloves concealed his hands . |	DEFAULT									
|He seemed to be unarmed . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Damn me , '' Mercy whispered . |	Mercy									
|I was disturbed . |	DEFAULT									
|That rider chilled me . |	DEFAULT									
|Something primitive deep inside me wanted to run . |	DEFAULT									
|But curiosity plagued me more . |	DEFAULT									
|Who was he ? |	DEFAULT									
|Had he come off that strange ship in the harbor ? |	DEFAULT									
|Why was he here ? |	DEFAULT									
|The eyeless gaze of the rider swept across us indifferently , as though passing over a flock of sheep . |										
|Then it jerked back , fixing on Silent . |	Silent									
|Silent met stare for stare , and showed no fear . |	Silent									
|And still he seemed somehow diminished . |	Silent									
|The column passed on , hardened , disciplined . |										
|Shaken , Mercy got our mob moving again . |	Mercy									
|We entered the Bastion only yards behind the strangers . |										
|We had arrested most of the more conservative Blue leadership . |										
|When word of the raid spread , the volatile types decided to flex their muscles . |										
|They sparked something monstrous . |										
|The perpetually abrasive weather does things to men 's reason . |										
|The Beryl mob is savage . |										
|Riots occur almost without provocation . |										
|When things go bad the dead number in the thousands . |										
|This was one of the worst times . |										
|The army is half the problem . |										
|A parade of weak , short-term Syndics let discipline lapse - . |										
|The troops are beyond control now . |										
|Generally , though , they will act against rioters . |										
|They see riot suppression as license to loot . |										
|The worst happened . |										
|Several cohorts from the Fork Barracks demanded a special donative before they would respond to a directive to restore order . |										
|The Syndic refused to pay . |										
|The cohorts mutinied . |										
|Mercy 's platoon hastily established a strongpoint near the Rubbish Gate and held off all three cohorts . |	Mercy									
|Most of our men were killed , but none ran . |										
|Mercy himself lost an eye , a finger , was wounded in shoulder and hip , and had more than a hundred holes in his shield when help arrived . |	Mercy									
|He came to me more dead than alive . |	Mercy									
|In the end , the mutineers scattered rather than face the rest of the Black Company . |	DEFAULT									
|The riots were the worst in memory . |										
|We lost almost a hundred brethren trying to suppress them . |										
|We could ill afford the loss of one . |										
|In the Groan the streets were carpet led with corpses . |										
|The rats grew fat . |										
|Clouds of vultures and ravens migrated from the countryside . |										
|The Captain ordered the Company into the Bastion . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Let it run its course , '' he said . |	DEFAULT
