did O
have O

tomorrows-though O
never O

The O
Queen O

was O
old O
and O
decadent O
and O
mad O
, O
filled O
with O
the O
stench O
of O
degeneracy O

moral O
dryrot O

Only O
a O
fool O
would O
be O
surprised O
by O
anything O
found O
creeping O
its O
night O
streets O

I O
had O
every O

wide O

praying O
for O
a O
breath O
off O
the O

, O
rotting O

and O
all O

There O
was O
n't O
enough O

I O
mopped O
my O

grimaced O
at O

for O

I O
took O
the O
long O
route O

along O
Trejan O

Wall O
, O
which O
overlooks O
Beryl O

harbor O
. O
Halfway O
oven O
I O
paused O
, O
stared O
north O
, O
past O
the O
mole O
and O
lighthouse O
and O
Fortress O
Island O
, O
at O
the O
Sea O
of O
Torments O
. O
Particolored O
sails O
speckled O
the O
dingy O
grey-brown O
water O
as O
coastal O
dhows O
scooted O
out O
along O
the O
spiderweb O
of O
routes O
linking O
the O
Jewel O

The O
upper O
air O
was O
still O

heavy O

hazy O

The O
horizon O
could O
not O
be O
discerned O

But O
down O
on O
the O
water O
the O
air O
was O
in O
motion O

There O
was O
always O
a O
breeze O
out O
around O
the O
Island O
, O
though O
it O
avoided O
the O
shore O
as O
if O
fearing O
leprosy O

Closer O
at O

, O
the O
wheeling O
gulls O
were O
as O
surly O

Another O
summer O
in O
service O
to O
the O
Syndic O
of O
Beryl I-PERSON
, O
sweating O
and O
grimy O
, O
thanklessly O
shielding O
him O

his O
undisciplined O

troops O

Another O
summer O
busting O
our O
butts O
for O
Curly I-PERSON

reward O

The O
pay O
was O
good O
, O
but O
not O
in O
coin O
of O
the O
soul O

Our O
forebrethren O
would O
be O
embarrassed O

Beryl O
is O
misery O
curdled O
, O
but O
also O
ancient O
and O
intriguing O

Its O
history O
is O
a O
bottomless O
well O
filled O
with O
murky O
water O
. O
I O
amuse O
myself O
plumbing O
its O
shadowy O
depths O
, O
trying O
to O
isolate O
fact O
from O
fiction O
, O
legend O
, O
and O
myth O
. O
No O
easy O
task O
, O
for O
the O
city O
's O
earlier O
historians O
wrote O
with O
an O
eye O
to O
pleasing O
the O
powers O
of O
their O
day O
. O
The O
most O
interesting O
period O
, O
for O
me O
, O
is O
the O
ancient O
kingdom O
, O
which O
is O
the O
least O
satisfactorily O
chronicled O
. O
It O
was O
then O
, O
in O
the O
reign O
of O
Niam O
, O
that O
the O
forvalaka O
came O
, O
were O
overcome O
after O
a O
decade O
of O
terror O
, O
and O
were O
confined O
in O
their O
dark O
tomb O
atop O
the O
Necropolitan O
Hill O
. O
Echoes O
of O
that O
terror O
persist O
in O
folklore O
and O
matronly O
admonitions O
to O
unruly O
children O
. O
No O
one O
recalls O
what O
the O
forvalaka O
were O
, O
now O
. O
I O
resumed O
walking O
, O
despairing O
of O
beating O
the O
heat O
. O
The O
sentries O
, O
in O
their O
shaded O
kiosks O
, O
wore O
towels O
draped O
around O
their O
necks O
. O
A O
breeze O
startled O
me O
. O
I O
faced O
the O
harbor O
. O
A O
ship O
was O
founding O
the O
Island O
, O
a O
great O
lumbering O
beast O
that O
dwarfed O
the O
dhows O
and O
feluccas O
. O
A O
silver O
skull O
bulged O
in O
the O
center O
of O
its O
full-bellied O
black O
sail O
. O
That O
skull O
's O
red O
eyes O
glowed O
. O
Fires O
flickered O
behind O
its O
broken O
teeth O
. O
A O
glittering O
silver O
band O
encircled O
the O
skull O
. O
`` O
What O
the O
hell O
is O
that O
? O
'' O
a O
sentry O
asked O
. O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

Whitey O
. O
'' O
The O
ship O
's O
size O
impressed O
me O
more O
than O
did O
its O
flashy O
sail O
. O
The O
four O
minor O
wizards O
we O
had O
with O
the O
Company O
could O
match O
that O
showmanship O
. O
But O
I O
'd O
never O
seen O
a O
galley O
sporting O
five O
banks O
of O
oars O
. O
I O
recalled O
my O
mission O
. O
I O
knocked O
on O
the O
Captain O
's O
door O
. O
He O
did O
not O
respond O
. O
I O
invited O
myself O
inside O
, O
found O
him O
snoring O
in O
his O
big O
wooden O
chair O

`` O

up O

`` O

was O

I O
had O
passed O
many O

something O

I O

not O
catch O

`` O
That O

A O
dozen O
citizens O
went O
down O

Blood O
pooled O
in O
low O
places O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Spectators O
gathered O
outside O
. O
Soon O
some O
adventurer O
would O
hit O
us O
from O
behind O
. O
A O
dagger O
nicked O
Mercy I-PERSON
. O
He O
lost O
patience O
. O
`` O
Silent I-PERSON
! O
'' O
Silent I-PERSON
was O
on O
the O
job O
already O
, O
but O
he O
was O
Silent I-PERSON
. O
That O
meant O
no O
sound O
, O
and O
very O
little O
flash O
or O
fury O
. O
Mole O
patrons O
began O
slapping O
their O
faces O
and O
pawing O
the O
air O
, O
forsaking O
us O
. O
They O
hopped O
and O
danced O
, O
grabbed O
their O
backs O
and O
behinds O
, O
squealed O
and O
howled O
piteously O
. O
Several O
collapsed O

`` O
What O
the O
hell O
did O
you O
do O
? O
'' O
I O
asked O
. O
Silent O
grinned O
, O
exposing O
sharp O
teeth O
. O
He O
passed O
a O
dusky O
paw O
across O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
saw O
the O
. O
Mole O
tram O
a O
slightly O
altered O
perspective O
. O
The O
bag O
he O
had O
lugged O
in O
from O
out O
of O
town O
proved O
to O
be O
one O
of O
those O
hornets O

nests O
you O
can O
, O
if O
you O
're O
unlucky O
, O
run O
into O
in O
the O
woods O
south O
of O
Beryl O

Its O
tenants O
were O
the O
bumblebee-looking O
monsters O
peasants O
call O
bald-faced O
hornets O
. O
They O
have O
a O
foul O
temper O
unrivalled O
anywhere O
in O
Nature O

They O
cowed O
the O

fast O
, O
without O
bothering O
our O
lads O
. O
`` O
Fine O
work O

Silent I-PERSON

Mercy I-PERSON
said O
, O
after O
having O
vented O
his O
fury O
on O
several O
hapless O
patrons O

He O
herded O
the O
survivors O
into O
the O
street O

examined O

Mercy I-PERSON
called O
that O
. O
Silent O
looked O
on O
, O
still O
grinning O
. O
He O
's O
not O
nice O
either O
, O
though O
he O
seldom O

directly O

We O
took O
more O
prisoners O
than O
expected O

The O

'd O
led O
us O
to O
Mole O

at O
a O
critical O
moment O

Poking O
around O
, O
our O
witch O
man O
had O
unearthed O
a O
prize O
, O
a O
crowd O
concealed O
in O
a O
hideout O
beneath O
the O
wine O
cellar O
. O
Among O
them O
were O
some O
of O
the O
best O
known O
Blues O

Mercy I-PERSON
chattered O
, O
wondering O
aloud O
how O
large O
a O
reward O
our O
informant O
deserved O
. O
No O
such O
informant O
existed O
. O
The O
yammer O
was O
meant O
to O
save O
our O
tame O
wizards O
from O
becoming O
prime O
targets O
. O
Our O
enemies O
would O
scurry O
around O
looking O
for O
phantom O
spies O
. O
`` O
Move O
them O
out O
, O
'' O
Mercy I-PERSON
ordered O

Still O
grinning O
, O
he O
eyed O
the O
sullen O
crowd O
. O
`` O
Think O
they O
'll O
try O
something O
? O
'' O
They O
did O
not O
. O
His O
supreme O
confidence O
cowed O
anyone O
who O
had O
ideas O
. O
We O
wound O
through O
mazelike O
streets O
half O
as O
old O
as O
the O
world O
, O
our O
prisoners O
shuffling O
listlessly O
. O
I O
gawked O
. O
My O
comrades O
are O
indifferent O
to O
the O
past O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
help O
being O
awed-and O
occasionally O
intimidated-by O
how O
time-deep O
Beryl O
's O
history O
runs O
. O
Mercy I-PERSON
called O
an O
unexpected O
halt O
. O
We O
had O
come O
to O
the O
Avenue O
of O
the O
Syndics O
' O
, O
which O
winds O
from O
the O
Customs O
House O
uptown O
to O
the O
Bastion O
's O
main O
gate O
. O
There O
was O
a O
procession O
on O
the O
Avenue O
. O
Though O
we O
reached O
the O
intersection O
first O
, O
Mercy I-PERSON
yielded O
the O
right-of-way O
. O
The O
procession O
consisted O
of O
a O
hundred O
armed O
men O
. O
They O
looked O
tougher O
than O
anyone O
in O
Beryl O
but O
us O
. O
At O
their O
head O
rode O
a O
dark O
figure O
on O
the O
biggest O
black O
stallion O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O
The O
rider O
was O
small O
, O
effeminately O
slim O
, O
and O
clad O
in O
worn O
black O
leather O
. O
He O
wore O
a O
black O
morion O
which O
concealed O
his O
head O
entirely O
. O
Black O
gloves O
concealed O
his O
hands O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
be O
unarmed O
. O
`` O
Damn O
me O
, O
'' O
Mercy I-PERSON
whispered O
. O
I O
was O
disturbed O
. O
That O
rider O
chilled O
me O
. O
Something O
primitive O
deep O
inside O
me O
wanted O
to O
run O
. O
But O
curiosity O
plagued O
me O
more O
. O
Who O
was O
he O
? O
Had O
he O
come O
off O
that O
strange O
ship O
in O
the O
harbor O
? O
Why O
was O
he O
here O
? O
The O
eyeless O
gaze O
of O
the O
rider O
swept O
across O
us O
indifferently O
, O
as O
though O
passing O
over O
a O
flock O
of O
sheep O
. O
Then O
it O
jerked O
back O
, O
fixing O
on O
Silent I-PERSON
. O
Silent I-PERSON
met O
stare O
for O
stare O
, O
and O
showed O
no O
fear O
. O
And O
still O
he O
seemed O
somehow O
diminished O
. O
The O
column O
passed O
on O
, O
hardened O
, O
disciplined O
. O
Shaken O
, O
Mercy I-PERSON
got O
our O
mob O
moving O
again O
. O
We O
entered O
the O
Bastion O
only O
yards O
behind O
the O
strangers O
. O
We O
had O
arrested O
most O
of O
the O
more O
conservative O
Blue O
leadership O
. O
When O
word O
of O
the O
raid O
spread O
, O
the O
volatile O
types O
decided O
to O
flex O
their O
muscles O
. O
They O
sparked O
something O
monstrous O
. O
The O
perpetually O
abrasive O
weather O
does O
things O
to O
men O
's O
reason O
. O
The O
Beryl O
mob O
is O
savage O
. O
Riots O
occur O
almost O
without O
provocation O
. O
When O
things O
go O
bad O
the O
dead O
number O
in O
the O
thousands O
. O
This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
times O
. O
The O
army O
is O
half O
the O
problem O
. O
A O
parade O
of O
weak O
, O
short-term O
Syndics O
let O
discipline O
lapse O
- O
. O
The O
troops O
are O
beyond O
control O
now O
. O
Generally O
, O
though O
, O
they O
will O
act O
against O
rioters O
. O
They O
see O
riot O
suppression O
as O
license O
to O
loot O
. O
The O
worst O
happened O
. O
Several O
cohorts O
from O
the O
Fork O
Barracks O
demanded O
a O
special O
donative O
before O
they O
would O
respond O
to O
a O
directive O
to O
restore O
order O
. O
The O
Syndic O
refused O
to O
pay O
. O
The O
cohorts O
mutinied O
. O
Mercy I-PERSON
's O
platoon O
hastily O
established O
a O
strongpoint O
near O
the O
Rubbish O
Gate O
and O
held O
off O
all O
three O
cohorts O
. O
Most O
of O
our O
men O
were O
killed O
, O
but O
none O
ran O
. O
Mercy I-PERSON
himself O
lost O
an O
eye O
, O
a O
finger O
, O
was O
wounded O
in O
shoulder O
and O
hip O
, O
and O
had O
more O
than O
a O
hundred O
holes O
in O
his O
shield O
when O
help O
arrived O
. O
He O
came O
to O
me O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
. O
In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
mutineers O
scattered O
rather O
than O
face O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Black O
Company O
. O
The O
riots O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
memory O
. O
We O
lost O
almost O
a O
hundred O
brethren O
trying O
to O
suppress O
them O
. O
We O
could O
ill O
afford O
the O
loss O
of O
one O
. O
In O
the O
Groan O
the O
streets O
were O
carpet O
led O
with O
corpses O
. O
The O
rats O
grew O
fat O
. O
Clouds O
of O
vultures O
and O
ravens O
migrated O
from O
the O
countryside O
. O
The O
Captain O
ordered O
the O
Company O
into O
the O
Bastion O

`` O
Let O
it O
run O
its O
course O
