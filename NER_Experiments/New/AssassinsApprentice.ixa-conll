both 	O

up 	O

down 	O
with 	O

him 	O
, 	O
not 	O

to 	O
anger 	O

For 	O
he 	O
suddenly 	O
dropped 	O
my 	O

and 	O
instead 	O
gripped 	O
me 	O
by 	O
the 	O
back 	O
of 	O
my 	O

swung 	O
me 	O
forward 	O

the 	O

rusty 	O
voice 	O

And 	O
when 	O
the 	O

continued 	O

at 	O
him 	O
, 	O
without 	O
judgment 	O

never 	O

his 	O

out 	O

I 	O
followed 	O
him 	O

down 	O
a 	O

I 	O
remember 	O
quite 	O
clearly 	O
how 	O

went 	O
down 	O

a 	O

two 	O
, 	O

whether 	O
this 	O
was 	O
from 	O
some 	O

that 	O
I 	O
make 	O
a 	O

at 	O
the 	O

behind 	O

up 	O

so 	O
I 	O
was 	O

both 	O

the 	O

one 	O

a 	O

something 	O
very 	O

wore 	O
a 	O
short 	O

he 	O
startled 	O
me 	O
, 	O
so 	O
that 	O
I 	O
dropped 	O
both 	O
bread 	O
and 	O
cheese 	O
. 	O
Yet 	O
he 	O
paid 	O
no 	O
mind 	O
to 	O
this 	O
as 	O
he 	O
turned 	O
my 	O
face 	O
toward 	O
the 	O
fire 	O
and 	O
studied 	O
me 	O
as 	O
if 	O
I 	O
were 	O
a 	O
map 	O
. 	O
His 	O
eyes 	O
met 	O
mine 	O
, 	O
and 	O
there 	O
was 	O
a 	O
sort 	O
of 	O
wildness 	O
in 	O
them 	O
, 	O
as 	O
if 	O
what 	O
he 	O
saw 	O
in 	O
my 	O
face 	O
were 	O
an 	O
injury 	O
I 	O
'd 	O
done 	O
him 	O
. 	O
I 	O
started 	O
to 	O
draw 	O
away 	O
from 	O
that 	O
look 	O
, 	O
but 	O
his 	O
grip 	O
would 	O
n't 	O
let 	O
me 	O
. 	O
So 	O
I 	O
stared 	O
back 	O
at 	O
him 	O
with 	O
as 	O
much 	O
defiance 	O
as 	O
I 	O
could 	O
muster 	O
, 	O
and 	O
saw 	O
his 	O
upset 	O
masked 	O
suddenly 	O
with 	O
a 	O
sort 	O
of 	O
reluctant 	O
wonder 	O
. 	O
And 	O
lastly 	O
he 	O
closed 	O
his 	O
eyes 	O
for 	O
a 	O
second 	O
, 	O
hooding 	O
them 	O
against 	O
some 	O
pain 	O
. 	O
It 	O
's 	O
a 	O

Burrich 	PERSON
said 	O
softly 	O
. 	O
He 	O
released 	O
my 	O
jaw 	O
and 	O
stooped 	O
awkwardly 	O
to 	O
pick 	O
up 	O
the 	O
bread 	O
and 	O
cheese 	O
I 	O
'd 	O
dropped 	O
. 	O
He 	O
brushed 	O
them 	O
off 	O
and 	O
handed 	O
them 	O
back 	O
to 	O
me 	O
. 	O
I 	O
stared 	O
at 	O
the 	O
thick 	O
bandaging 	O
on 	O
his 	O
right 	O
calf 	O
and 	O
over 	O
his 	O
knee 	O
that 	O
had 	O
kept 	O
him 	O
from 	O
bending 	O
his 	O
leg 	O

He 	O
reseated 	O
himself 	O
and 	O
refilled 	O
his 	O
mug 	O
from 	O
a 	O
pitcher 	O
on 	O
the 	O
table 	O

He 	O
drank 	O
again 	O
, 	O
studying 	O
me 	O
over 	O
the 	O
rim 	O
of 	O
his 	O

a 	O

incautiously 	O

Burrich 	O
swung 	O
his 	O
gaze 	O
to 	O
the 	O
man 	O
as 	O
he 	O
set 	O
his 	O
mug 	O
down 	O

For 	O
a 	O
moment 	O
he 	O
did 	O
n't 	O
speak 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
sensed 	O
that 	O
silence 	O
hovering 	O
again 	O

, 	O
even 	O
so 	O
, 	O
the 	O

agreed 	O
abruptly 	O
, 	O
and 	O
Jason 	PERSON
nodded 	O
like 	O

in 	O

Young 	PERSON
as 	O
I 	O
was 	O
, 	O
I 	O
still 	O
wondered 	O
what 	O

was 	O
who 	O
, 	O
with 	O
one 	O

This 	O

everyone 	O

Burrich 	O
, 	O
at 	O
a 	O
loss 	O
for 	O
words 	O

The 	O
silence 	O
lingered 	O
as 	O
I 	O
finished 	O
bread 	O
and 	O
cheese 	O
and 	O
meat 	O
, 	O
and 	O
washed 	O
it 	O
down 	O

The 	O

left 	O
the 	O
room 	O
gradually 	O
, 	O
in 	O
twos 	O
and 	O
threes 	O
, 	O
and 	O
still 	O
he 	O
sat 	O
there 	O
, 	O
drinking 	O
and 	O
looking 	O
at 	O
me 	O
. 	O
Well 	O
, 	O
he 	O
said 	O
at 	O
long 	O
last 	O
. 	O
If 	O
I 	O
know 	O
your 	O
father 	O
, 	O
he 	O
'll 	O
face 	O
up 	O

it 	O
square 	O

do 	O
what 	O

Probably 	O
whatever 	O

the 	O
most 	O

He 	O
watched 	O
me 	O
silently 	O
a 	O
moment 	O
longer 	O

Had 	O
enough 	O
to 	O

he 	O
asked 	O
at 	O
last 	O

I 	O
nodded 	O
, 	O
and 	O
he 	O
stood 	O
stiffly 	O
, 	O
to 	O

me 	O
off 	O
the 	O

he 	O
said 	O
, 	O
and 	O
moved 	O
out 	O
of 	O
the 	O
kitchen 	O
and 	O
down 	O
a 	O
different 	O
corridor 	O
. 	O
His 	O
stiff 	O
leg 	O
made 	O
his 	O
gait 	O
ungainly 	O
, 	O
and 	O
perhaps 	O
the 	O
beer 	O
had 	O
something 	O
to 	O
do 	O
with 	O
it 	O
as 	O
well 	O
. 	O
Certainly 	O
I 	O
had 	O
no 	O
trouble 	O
in 	O
keeping 	O
up 	O
. 	O
We 	O
came 	O
at 	O
last 	O
to 	O
a 	O
heavy 	O
door 	O
, 	O
and 	O
a 	O
guard 	O
who 	O
nodded 	O
us 	O
through 	O
with 	O
a 	O
devouring 	O
stare 	O
at 	O
me 	O
. 	O
Outside 	O
, 	O
a 	O
chill 	O
wind 	O
was 	O
blowing 	O

All 	O
the 	O
ice 	O
and 	O
snow 	O
that 	O
had 	O
softened 	O
during 	O
the 	O
day 	O
had 	O
gone 	O
back 	O
to 	O
sharpness 	O
with 	O
the 	O
coming 	O
of 	O
night 	O
. 	O
The 	O
path 	O
cracked 	O
under 	O
my 	O
feet 	O
, 	O
and 	O
the 	O
wind 	O
seemed 	O
to 	O
find 	O
every 	O
crack 	O
and 	O
gap 	O
in 	O
my 	O
garments 	O
. 	O
My 	O
feet 	O

had 	O
been 	O
warmed 	O
by 	O
the 	O
kitchen 	O
's 	O
fire 	O
, 	O
but 	O
not 	O
quite 	O
dried 	O
, 	O
so 	O
the 	O
cold 	O
seized 	O
on 	O
them 	O
. 	O
I 	O
remember 	O
darkness 	O
, 	O
and 	O
the 	O
sudden 	O
tiredness 	O
that 	O
came 	O
over 	O
me 	O
, 	O
a 	O
terrible 	O
weepy 	O
sleepiness 	O
that 	O
dragged 	O
at 	O
me 	O
as 	O
I 	O
followed 	O
the 	O
strange 	O
man 	O
with 	O
the 	O
bandaged 	O
leg 	O
through 	O
the 	O
chill 	O
, 	O
dark 	O
courtyard 	O

There 	O
were 	O
tall 	O
walls 	O
around 	O
us 	O

moved 	O
intermittently 	O
atop 	O
them 	O

dark 	O
shadows 	O

only 	O
as 	O
they 	O
blotted 	O
the 	O
stars 	O
occasionally 	O
from 	O
the 	O
sky 	O
. 	O
The 	O
cold 	O
bit 	O
at 	O
me 	O
, 	O
and 	O
I 	O
stumbled 	O
and 	O
slipped 	O
on 	O
the 	O
icy 	O
pathway 	O
. 	O
But 	O
something 	O
about 	O
Burrich 	PERSON
did 	O
not 	O
permit 	O
me 	O
to 	O
whimper 	O
or 	O
beg 	O
quarter 	O
from 	O
him 	O
. 	O
Instead 	O
I 	O
followed 	O
him 	O
doggedly 	O
. 	O
We 	O
reached 	O
a 	O
building 	O
and 	O
he 	O
dragged 	O
open 	O
a 	O
heavy 	O
door 	O

out 	O

A 	O
sleepy 	O

sat 	O
up 	O
in 	O
his 	O
nest 	O
of 	O
straw 	O
, 	O
blinking 	O
like 	O
a 	O
rumpled 	O
fledgling 	O
. 	O
At 	O
a 	O
word 	O
from 	O
Burrich 	PERSON
he 	O
lay 	O
down 	O
again 	O
, 	O
curling 	O
up 	O
small 	O
in 	O
the 	O
straw 	O
and 	O
closing 	O
his 	O

moved 	O
past 	O
him 	O

Burrich 	PERSON
dragging 	O
the 	O
door 	O
to 	O
behind 	O
us 	O

He 	O
took 	O
the 	O
lantern 	O
that 	O
burned 	O
dimly 	O
by 	O
the 	O
door 	O
and 	O
led 	O
me 	O
on 	O
. 	O
I 	O
entered 	O
a 	O
different 	O
world 	O
then 	O
, 	O
a 	O
night 	O
world 	O
where 	O
animals 	O
shifted 	O

breathed 	O
in 	O

lifted 	O
their 	O

I 	O
found 	O
myself 	O
facing 	O
an 	O
ample 	O
box 	O
stall 	O
, 	O
populated 	O
with 	O
three 	O
hounds 	O

thumping 	O
in 	O
the 	O
straw 	O
at 	O

I 	O
moved 	O
uncertainly 	O
in 	O
amongst 	O
them 	O
and 	O
finally 	O
lay 	O
down 	O
next 	O
to 	O
an 	O

with 	O
a 	O
whitened 	O

The 	O

regarded 	O
me 	O
with 	O
a 	O
certain 	O
suspicion 	O

but 	O
the 	O
third 	O
was 	O

much 	O

put 	O
an 	O

around 	O
him 	O

him 	O

then 	O
cuddled 	O
in 	O

them 	O
as 	O
Burrich 	O
had 	O
advised 	O

threw 	O

A 	O
very 	O
large 	O

against 	O
