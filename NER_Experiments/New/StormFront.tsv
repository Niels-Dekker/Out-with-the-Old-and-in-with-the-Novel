|He did n't sound right . |	DEFAULT									
|His footsteps fell more heavily , jauntily , and he whistled . |	DEFAULT									
|A new guy . |										
|He whistled his way to my office door , then fell silent for a moment . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Then he laughed . |	DEFAULT									
|Then he knocked . |	DEFAULT									
|I winced . |	DEFAULT									
|My mail comes through the mail slot unless it 's registered . |	DEFAULT									
|I get a really limited selection of registered mail , and it 's never good news . |	DEFAULT									
|I got up out of my office chair and opened the door . |	DEFAULT									
|The new mailman , who looked like a basketball with arms and legs and a sunburned , balding head , was chuckling at the sign on the door glass . |										
|He glanced at me and hooked a thumb toward the sign . |	DEFAULT									
|` You 're kidding , right ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|I read the sign -LRB- people change it occasionally -RRB- , and shook my head . |	DEFAULT									
|` No , I 'm serious . |	DEFAULT									
|Can I have my mail , please . ' |	DEFAULT									
|` So , uh . |										
|Like parties , shows , stuff like that ? ' |										
|He looked past me , as though he expected to see a white tiger , or possibly some skimpily clad assistants prancing around my one-room office . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I sighed , not in the mood to get mocked again , and reached for the mail he held in his hand . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` No , not like that . |										
|I do n't do parties . ' |	DEFAULT									
|He held on to it , his head tilted curiously . |	DEFAULT									
|` So what ? |										
|Some kinda fortune-teller ? |										
|Cards and crystal balls and things ? ' |										
|` No , ' I told him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` I 'm not a psychic . ' |	DEFAULT									
|I tugged at the mail . |	DEFAULT									
|He held on to it . |	DEFAULT									
|` What are you , then ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` What 's the sign on the door say ? ' |										
|` It says ` Harry Dresden . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|Wizard . ' ' |										
|` That 's me , ' I confirmed . |	DEFAULT									
|` An actual wizard ? ' |										
|he asked , grinning , as though I should let him in on the joke . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Spells and potions ? |										
|Demons and incantations ? |										
|Subtle and quick to anger ? ' |										
|` Not so subtle . ' |										
|I jerked the mail out of his hand and looked pointedly at his clipboard . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Can I sign for my mail please . ' |	DEFAULT									
|The new mailman 's grin vanished , replaced with a scowl . |										
|He passed over the clipboard to let me sign for the mail -LRB- another late notice from my landlord -RRB- , and said , ` You 're a nut . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|That 's what you are . ' |	DEFAULT									
|He took his clipboard back , and said , ` You have a nice day , sir . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I watched him go . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Typical , ' I muttered , and shut the door . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|My name is Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|Conjure by it at your own risk . |										
|I 'm a wizard . |	DEFAULT									
|I work out of an office in midtown Chicago . |	DEFAULT									
|As far as I know , I 'm the only openly practicing professional wizard in the country . |	DEFAULT									
|You can find me in the yellow pages , under ` Wizards . ' |	DEFAULT									
|Believe it or not , I 'm the only one there . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|My ad looks like this : HARRY DRESDEN-WIZARD Lost Items Found . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|Paranormal Investigations . |										
|Consulting . |										
|Advice . |										
|Reasonable Rates . |										
|No Love Potions , Endless Purses , Parties , or Other Entertainment You 'd be surprised how many people call just to ask me if I 'm serious . |	DEFAULT									
|But then , if you 'd seen the things I 'd seen , if you knew half of what I knew , you 'd wonder how anyone could not think I was serious . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The end of the twentieth century and the dawn of the new millennium had seen something of a renaissance in the public awareness of the paranormal . |										
|Psychics , haunts , vampires-you name it . |										
|People still did n't take them seriously , but all the things Science had promised us had n't come to pass . |										
|Disease was still a problem . |										
|Starvation was still a problem . |										
|Violence and crime and war were still problems . |										
|In spite of the advance of technology , things just had n't changed the way everyone had hoped and thought they would . |										
|Science , the largest religion of the twentieth century , had become somewhat tarnished by images of exploding space shuttles , crack babies , and a generation of complacent Americans who had allowed the television to raise their children . |										
|People were looking for something-I think they just did n't know what . |	DEFAULT									
|And even though they were once again starting to open their eyes to the world of magic and the arcane that had been with them all the while , they still thought I must be some kind of joke . |	DEFAULT									
|Anyway , it had been a slow month . |										
|A slow pair of months , actually . |										
|My rent from February did n't get paid until the tenth of March , and it was looking like it might be even longer until I got caught up for this month . |	DEFAULT									
|My only job had been the previous week , when I 'd gone down to Branson , Missouri , to investigate a country singer 's possibly haunted house . |	DEFAULT									
|It had n't been . |										
|My client had n't been happy with that answer , and had been even less happy when I suggested he lay off of any intoxicating substances and try to get some exercise and sleep , and see if that did n't help things more than an exorcism . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I 'd gotten travel expenses plus an hour 's pay , and gone away feeling I had done the honest , righteous , and impractical thing . |	DEFAULT									
|I heard later that he 'd hired a shyster psychic to come in and perform a ceremony with a lot of incense and black lights . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Some people . |										
|I finished up my paperback and tossed it into the DONE box . |	DEFAULT									
|There was a pile of read and discarded paperbacks in a cardboard box on one side of my desk , the spines bent and the pages mangled . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'm terribly hard on books . |	DEFAULT									
|I was eyeing the pile of unread books , considering which to start next , given that I had no real work to do , when my phone rang . |	DEFAULT									
|I stared at it in a somewhat surly fashion . |	DEFAULT									
|We wizards are terrific at brooding . |										
|After the third ring , when I thought I would n't sound a little too eager , I picked up the receiver and said , ` Dresden . ' |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|` Oh . |										
|Is this , um , Harry Dresden ? |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|The , ah , wizard ? ' |										
|Her tone was apologetic , as though she were terribly afraid she would be insulting me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|No , I thought . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|It 's Harry Dresden the , ah , lizard . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|Harry the wizard is one door down . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|It is the prerogative of wizards to be grumpy . |										
|It is not , however , the prerogative of freelance consultants who are late on their rent , so instead of saying something smart , I told the woman on the phone , ` Yes , ma'am . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|How can I help you today ? ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` I , um , ' she said . |	DEFAULT									
|` I 'm not sure . |	DEFAULT									
|I 've lost something , and I think maybe you could help me . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Finding lost articles is a specialty , ' I said . |	DEFAULT									
|` What would I be looking for ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|There was a nervous pause . |										
|` My husband , ' she said . |	DEFAULT									
|She had a voice that was a little hoarse , like a cheerleader who 'd been working a long tournament , but had enough weight of years in it to place her as an adult . |	DEFAULT									
|My eyebrows went up . |	DEFAULT									
|` Ma'am , I 'm not really a missing-persons specialist . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Have you contacted the police or a private investigator ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` No , ' she said , quickly . |	DEFAULT									
|` No , they ca n't . |										
|That is , I have n't . |	DEFAULT									
|Oh dear , this is all so complicated . |										
|Not something someone can talk about on the phone . |										
|I 'm sorry to have taken up your time , Mr. Dresden . ' |	DEFAULT	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden								
|` Hold on now , ' I said quickly . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|` I 'm sorry , you did n't tell me your name . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|There was that nervous pause again , as though she were checking a sheet of written notes before answering . |	Monica No-Last-Name									
|` Call me Monica . ' |	Monica No-Last-Name									
|People who know diddly about wizards do n't like to give us their names . |										
|They 're convinced that if they give a wizard their name from their own lips it could be used against them . |										
|To be fair , they 're right . |										
|I had to be as polite and harmless as I could . |	DEFAULT									
|She was about to hang up out of pure indecision , and I needed the job . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I could probably turn hubby up , if I worked at it . |	DEFAULT									
|` Okay , Monica , ' I told her , trying to sound as melodious and friendly as I could . |	Monica No-Last-Name	DEFAULT								
|` If you feel your situation is of a sensitive nature , maybe you could come by my office and talk about it . |	Monica No-Last-Name	DEFAULT								
|If it turns out that I can help you best , I will , and if not , then I can direct you to someone I think can help you better . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I gritted my teeth and pretended I was smiling . |	DEFAULT									
|` No charge . ' |										
|It must have been the no charge that did it . |										
|She agreed to come right out to the office , and told me that she would be there in an hour . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|That put her estimated arrival at about two-thirty . |	DEFAULT									
|Plenty of time to go out and get some lunch , then get back to the office to meet her . |	DEFAULT									
|The phone rang again almost the instant I put it down , making me jump . |	DEFAULT									
|I peered at it . |	DEFAULT									
|I do n't trust electronics . |	DEFAULT									
|Anything manufactured after the forties is suspect-and does n't seem to have much liking for me . |	DEFAULT									
|You name it : cars , radios , telephones , TVs , VCRs-none of them seem to behave well for me . |	DEFAULT									
|I do n't even like to use automatic pencils . |	DEFAULT									
|I answered the phone with the same false cheer I had summoned up for Monica Husband-Missing . |	DEFAULT	Monica No-Last-Name								
|` This is Dresden , may I help you ? ' |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden	Monica No-Last-Name								
|` Harry , I need you at the Madison in the next ten minutes . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden	DEFAULT								
|Can you be there ? ' |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|The voice on the other end of the line was also a woman 's , cool , brisk , businesslike . |										
|` Why , Lieutenant Murphy , ' I gushed , overflowing with saccharine , ` It 's good to hear from you , too . |	Karrin Murphy	DEFAULT								
|It 's been so long . |										
|Oh , they 're fine , fine . |										
|And your family ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|` Save it , Harry . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|I 've got a couple of bodies here , and I need you to take a look around . ' |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden	DEFAULT								
|I sobered immediately . |	DEFAULT									
|Karrin Murphy was the director of Special Investigations out of downtown Chicago , a de facto appointee of the Police Commissioner to investigate any crimes dubbed unusual . |	Karrin Murphy									
|Vampire attacks , troll mauraudings , and faery abductions of children did n't fit in very neatly on a police report-but at the same time , people got attacked , infants got stolen , property was damaged or destroyed . |										
|And someone had to look into it . |										
|In Chicago , or pretty much anywhere in Chicagoland , that person was Karrin Murphy . |	Karrin Murphy									
|I was her library of the supernatural on legs , and a paid consultant for the police department . |	DEFAULT	Karrin Murphy								
|But two bodies ? |										
|Two deaths by means unknown ? |										
|I had n't handled anything like that for her before . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Where are you ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|I asked her . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Madison Hotel on Tenth , seventh floor . ' |										
|` That 's only a fifteen-minute walk from my office , ' I said . |	DEFAULT									
|` So you can be here in fifteen minutes . |	DEFAULT									
|Good . ' |										
|` Um , ' I said . |	DEFAULT									
|I looked at the clock . |	DEFAULT									
|Monica No-Last-Name would be here in a little more than forty-five minutes . |	Monica No-Last-Name									
|` I 've sort of got an appointment . ' |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|` Dresden , I 've sort of got a pair of corpses with no leads and no suspects , and a killer walking around loose . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden	DEFAULT								
|Your appointment can wait . ' |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|My temper flared . |	DEFAULT									
|It does that occasionally . |										
|` It ca n't , actually , ' I said . |	DEFAULT									
|` But I 'll tell you what . |	DEFAULT									
|I 'll stroll on over and take a look around , and be back here in time for it . ' |	DEFAULT									
|` Have you had lunch yet ? ' |	DEFAULT									
|she asked . |	DEFAULT									
|` What ? ' |										
|She repeated the question . |	DEFAULT									
|` No , ' I said . |	DEFAULT									
|` Do n't . ' |										
|There was a pause , and when she spoke again , there was a sort of greenish tone to her words . |	DEFAULT									
|` It 's bad . ' |										
|` How bad are we talking here , Murph ? ' |	Karrin Murphy									
|Her voice softened , and that scared me more than any images of gore or violent death could have . |	Karrin Murphy	DEFAULT								
|Murphy was the original tough girl , and she prided herself on never showing weakness . |	Karrin Murphy									
|` It 's bad , Harry . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|Please do n't take too long . |										
|Special Crimes is itching to get their fingers on this one , and I know you do n't like people to touch the scene before you can look around . ' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` I 'm on the way , ' I told her , already standing and pulling on my jacket . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` Seventh floor , ' she reminded me . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|` See you there . ' |	DEFAULT									
|` Okay . ' |										
|I turned off the lights to my office , went out the door , and locked up behind me , frowning . |	DEFAULT									
|I was n't sure how long it was going to take to investigate Murphy 's scene , and I did n't want to miss out on speaking with Monica Ask-Me-No-Questions . |	DEFAULT	Karrin Murphy	Monica No-Last-Name							
|So I opened the door again , got out a piece of paper and a thumbtack , and wrote : Out briefly . |	DEFAULT									
|Back for appointment at 2:30 . |										
|Dresden That done , I started down the stairs . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|I rarely use the elevator , even though I 'm on the fifth floor . |	Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden									
|Like I said , I do n't trust machines . |	DEFAULT									
|They 're always breaking down on me just when I need them . |	DEFAULT									
|Besides which . |										
|If I were someone in this town using magic to kill people two at a time , and I did n't want to get caught , I 'd make sure that I removed the only practicing wizard the police department kept on retainer . |	DEFAULT									
|I liked my odds on the stairwell a lot better than I did in the cramped confines of the elevator . |	DEFAULT									
|Paranoid ? |										
|Probably . |										
|But just because you 're paranoid does n't mean that there is n't an invisible demon about to eat your face . |	DEFAULT
