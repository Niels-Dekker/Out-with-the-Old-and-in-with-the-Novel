They O
were O
the O
last O
people O
you O
'd O
expect O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
anything O
strange O
or O
mysterious O
, O
because O
they O
just O
did O
n't O
hold O
with O
such O
nonsense O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
was O
the O
director O
of O
a O
firm O
called O
Grunnings LOC
, O
which O
made O
drills O
. O
He O
was O
a O
big O
, O
beefy O
man O
with O
hardly O
any O
neck O
, O
although O
he O
did O
have O
a O
very O
large O
mustache O
. O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
was O
thin O
and O
blonde O
and O
had O
nearly O
twice O
the O
usual O
amount O
of O
neck O
, O
which O
came O
in O
very O
useful O
as O
she O
spent O
so O
much O
of O
her O
time O
craning O
over O
garden O
fences O
, O
spying O
on O
the O
neighbors O
. O
The O
Dursleys MISC
had O
a O
small O
son O
called O
Dudley PER
and O
in O
their O
opinion O
there O
was O
no O
finer O
boy O
anywhere O
. O
The O
Dursleys MISC
had O
everything O
they O
wanted O
, O
but O
they O
also O
had O
a O
secret O
, O
and O
their O
greatest O
fear O
was O
that O
somebody O
would O
discover O
it O
. O
They O
did O
n't O
think O
they O
could O
bear O
it O
if O
anyone O
found O
out O
about O
the O
Potters O
. O
Mrs. O
Potter PER
was O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
's O
sister O
, O
but O
they O
had O
n't O
met O
for O
several O
years O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
pretended O
she O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
sister O
, O
because O
her O
sister O
and O
her O
good-for-nothing O
husband O
were O
as O
unDursleyish O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
be O
. O
The O
Dursleys MISC
shuddered O
to O
think O
what O
the O
neighbors O
would O
say O
if O
the O
Potters O
arrived O
in O
the O
street O
. O
The O
Dursleys MISC
knew O
that O
the O
Potters O
had O
a O
small O
son O
, O
too O
, O
but O
they O
had O
never O
even O
seen O
him O
. O
This O
boy O
was O
another O
good O
reason O
for O
keeping O
the O
Potters O
away O
; O
they O
did O
n't O
want O
Dudley PER
mixing O
with O
a O
child O
like O
that O
. O
When O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
woke O
up O
on O
the O
dull O
, O
gray O
Tuesday O
our O
story O
starts O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
about O
the O
cloudy O
sky O
outside O
to O
suggest O
that O
strange O
and O
mysterious O
things O
would O
soon O
be O
happening O
all O
over O
the O
country O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
hummed O
as O
he O
picked O
out O
his O
most O
boring O
tie O
for O
work O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
gossiped O
away O
happily O
as O
she O
wrestled O
a O
screaming O
Dudley PER
into O
his O
high O
chair O
. O
None O
of O
them O
noticed O
a O
large O
, O
tawny O
owl O
flutter O
past O
the O
window O
. O
At O
half O
past O
eight O
, O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
picked O
up O
his O
briefcase O
, O
pecked O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
on O
the O
cheek O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
kiss O
Dudley PER
good-bye O
but O
missed O
, O
because O
Dudley PER
was O
now O
having O
a O
tantrum O
and O
throwing O
his O
cereal O
at O
the O
walls O
. O
' O
Little O
tyke O
, O
' O
chortled O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
as O
he O
left O
the O
house O
. O
He O
got O
into O
his O
car O
and O
backed O
out O
of O
number O
four O
's O
drive O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
street O
that O
he O
noticed O
the O
first O
sign O
of O
something O
peculiar O
-- O
a O
cat O
reading O
a O
map O
. O
For O
a O
second O
, O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
did O
n't O
realize O
what O
he O
had O
seen O
-- O
then O
he O
jerked O
his O
head O
around O
to O
look O
again O
. O
There O
was O
a O
tabby O
cat O
standing O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
Privet LOC
Drive LOC
, O
but O
there O
was O
n't O
a O
map O
in O
sight O
. O
What O
could O
he O
have O
been O
thinking O
of O
? O
It O
must O
have O
been O
a O
trick O
of O
the O
light O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
blinked O
and O
stared O
at O
the O
cat O
. O
It O
stared O
back O
. O
As O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
drove O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
up O
the O
road O
, O
he O
watched O
the O
cat O
in O
his O
mirror O
. O
It O
was O
now O
reading O
the O
sign O
that O
said O
Privet LOC
Drive LOC
-- O
no O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
sign O
; O
cats O
could O
n't O
read O
maps O
or O
signs O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
gave O
himself O
a O
little O
shake O
and O
put O
the O
cat O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
. O
As O
he O
drove O
toward O
town O
he O
thought O
of O
nothing O
except O
a O
large O
order O
of O
drills O
he O
was O
hoping O
to O
get O
that O
day O
. O
But O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
town O
, O
drills O
were O
driven O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
by O
something O
else O
. O
As O
he O
sat O
in O
the O
usual O
morning O
traffic O
jam O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
help O
noticing O
that O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
strangely O
dressed O
people O
about O
. O
People O
in O
cloaks O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
could O
n't O
bear O
people O
who O
dressed O
in O
funny O
clothes O
-- O
the O
getups O
you O
saw O
on O
young O
people O
! O
He O
supposed O
this O
was O
some O
stupid O
new O
fashion O
. O
He O
drummed O
his O
fingers O
on O
the O
steering O
wheel O
and O
his O
eyes O
fell O
on O
a O
huddle O
of O
these O
weirdos O
standing O
quite O
close O
by O
. O
They O
were O
whispering O
excitedly O
together O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
was O
enraged O
to O
see O
that O
a O
couple O
of O
them O
were O
n't O
young O
at O
all O
; O
why O
, O
that O
man O
had O
to O
be O
older O
than O
he O
was O
, O
and O
wearing O
an O
emerald-green O
cloak O
! O
The O
nerve O
of O
him O
! O
But O
then O
it O
struck O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
that O
this O
was O
probably O
some O
silly O
stunt O
-- O
these O
people O
were O
obviously O
collecting O
for O
something O
... O
yes O
, O
that O
would O
be O
it O
. O
The O
traffic O
moved O
on O
and O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
arrived O
in O
the O
Grunnings LOC
parking O
lot O
, O
his O
mind O
back O
on O
drills O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
always O
sat O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
window O
in O
his O
office O
on O
the O
ninth O
floor O
. O
If O
he O
had O
n't O
, O
he O
might O
have O
found O
it O
harder O
to O
concentrate O
on O
drills O
that O
morning O
. O
He O
did O
n't O
see O
the O
owls O
swoop O
ing O
past O
in O
broad O
daylight O
, O
though O
people O
down O
in O
the O
street O
did O
; O
they O
pointed O
and O
gazed O
open O
- O
mouthed O
as O
owl O
after O
owl O
sped O
overhead O
. O
Most O
of O
them O
had O
never O
seen O
an O
owl O
even O
at O
nighttime O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
, O
however O
, O
had O
a O
perfectly O
normal O
, O
owl-free O
morning O
. O
He O
yelled O
at O
five O
different O
people O
. O
He O
made O
several O
important O
telephone O
calls O
and O
shouted O
a O
bit O
more O
. O
He O
was O
in O
a O
very O
good O
mood O
until O
lunchtime O
, O
when O
he O
thought O
he O
'd O
stretch O
his O
legs O
and O
walk O
across O
the O
road O
to O
buy O
himself O
a O
bun O
from O
the O
bakery O
. O
He O
'd O
forgotten O
all O
about O
the O
people O
in O
cloaks O
until O
he O
passed O
a O
group O
of O
them O
next O
to O
the O
baker O
's O
. O
He O
eyed O
them O
angrily O
as O
he O
passed O
. O
He O
did O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
but O
they O
made O
him O
uneasy O
. O
This O
bunch O
were O
whispering O
excitedly O
, O
too O
, O
and O
he O
could O
n't O
see O
a O
single O
collecting O
tin O
. O
It O
was O
on O
his O
way O
back O
past O
them O
, O
clutching O
a O
large O
doughnut O
in O
a O
bag O
, O
that O
he O
caught O
a O
few O
words O
of O
what O
they O
were O
saying O
. O
' O
The O
Potters O
, O
that O
's O
right O
, O
that O
's O
what O
I O
heard O
yes O
, O
their O
son O
, O
Harry PER
' O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
stopped O
dead O
. O
Fear O
flooded O
him O
. O
He O
looked O
back O
at O
the O
whisperers O
as O
if O
he O
wanted O
to O
say O
something O
to O
them O
, O
but O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O
He O
dashed O
back O
across O
the O
road O
, O
hurried O
up O
to O
his O
office O
, O
snapped O
at O
his O
secretary O
not O
to O
disturb O
him O
, O
seized O
his O
telephone O
, O
and O
had O
almost O
finished O
dialing O
his O
home O
number O
when O
he O
changed O
his O
mind O
. O
He O
put O
the O
receiver O
back O
down O
and O
stroked O
his O
mustache O
, O
thinking O
... O
no O
, O
he O
was O
being O
stupid O
. O
Potter PER
was O
n't O
such O
an O
unusual O
name O
. O
He O
was O
sure O
there O
were O
lots O
of O
people O
called O
Potter PER
who O
had O
a O
son O
called O
Harry PER
. O
Come O
to O
think O
of O
it O
, O
he O
was O
n't O
even O
sure O
his O
nephew O
was O
called O
Harry PER
. O
He O
'd O
never O
even O
seen O
the O
boy O
. O
It O
might O
have O
been O
Harvey PER
. O
Or O
Harold PER
. O
There O
was O
no O
point O
in O
worrying O
Mrs. O
Dursley PER
; O
she O
always O
got O
so O
upset O
at O
any O
mention O
of O
her O
sister O
. O
He O
did O
n't O
blame O
her O
-- O
if O
he O
'd O
had O
a O
sister O
like O
that O
... O
but O
all O
the O
same O
, O
those O
people O
in O
cloaks O
.. O
. O
He O
found O
it O
a O
lot O
harder O
to O
concentrate O
on O
drills O
that O
afternoon O
and O
when O
he O
left O
the O
building O
at O
five O
o'clock O
, O
he O
was O
still O
so O
worried O
that O
he O
walked O
straight O
into O
someone O
just O
outside O
the O
door O
. O
' O
Sorry O
, O
' O
he O
grunted O
, O
as O
the O
tiny O
old O
man O
stumbled O
and O
almost O
fell O
. O
It O
was O
a O
few O
seconds O
before O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
realized O
that O
the O
man O
was O
wearing O
a O
violet O
cloak O
. O
He O
did O
n't O
seem O
at O
all O
upset O
at O
being O
almost O
knocked O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
his O
face O
split O
into O
a O
wide O
smile O
and O
he O
said O
in O
a O
squeaky O
voice O
that O
made O
passersby O
stare O
, O
' O
Do O
n't O
be O
sorry O
, O
my O
dear O
sir O

And O
the O
old O
man O
hugged O
Mr. O

around O
the O
middle O
and O
walked O
off O
. O
Mr. O
Dursley PER
stood O
rooted O
to O
the O
spot O
. O
He O
had O
been O
hugged O
by O
a O
complete O
stranger O
. O
He O
also O
thought O
he O
had O
been O
called O
a O
Muggle MISC
, O
whatever O
that O
was O
. O
He O
was O
rattled O
. O
He O
hurried O
to O
his O
car O
and O
set O
off O
for O
home O
, O
hoping O
he O
was O
imagining O
things O
, O
which O
he O
had O
never O
hoped O
before O
, O
because O
he O
did O
n't O
approve O
of O
imagination O

As O
he O
pulled O
into O
the O
driveway O
of O
number O
four O

the O
first O
thing O
he O
saw O

and O
it O
did O

improve O
his O
mood O

was O
the O
tabby O
cat O

'd O
spotted O
that O
morning O

on O
his O
garden O

was O
sure O
it O

it O

the O

markings O
around O
its O
eyes O

' O
Shoo O

Mr. O

loudly O
. O
The O
cat O
did O
n't O
move O
. O
It O
just O
gave O
him O
a O
stern O
look O
. O
Was O
this O
normal O
cat O
behavior O
? O
Mr. O

wondered O

Trying O
to O
pull O
himself O
together O
, O
he O
let O
himself O
into O
the O
house O

He O
was O
still O
