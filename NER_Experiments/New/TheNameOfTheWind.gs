IT O
WAS O
FELLING O
NIGHT O
, O
and O
the O
usual O
crowd O
had O
gathered O
at O
the O
Waystone O
Inn O
. O
Five O
was O
n't O
much O
of O
a O
crowd O
, O
but O
five O
was O
as O
many O
as O
the O
Waystone O
ever O
saw O
these O
days O
, O
times O
being O
what O
they O
were O
. O
Old I-PERSON
Cob I-PERSON
was O
filling O
his O
role O
as O
storyteller O
and O
advice O
dispensary O
. O
The O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
sipped O
their O
drinks O
and O
listened O
. O
In O
the O
back O
room O
a O
young O
innkeeper O
stood O
out O
of O
sight O
behind O
the O
door O
, O
smiling O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
the O
details O
of O
a O
familiar O
story O
. O
`` O
When O
he O
awoke O
, O
Taborlin I-PERSON
the O
Great O
found O
himself O
locked O
in O
a O
high O
tower O
. O
They O
had O
taken O
his O
sword O
and O
stripped O
him O
of O
his O
tools O
: O
key O
, O
coin O
, O
and O
candle O
were O
all O
gone O
. O
But O
that O
were O
n't O
even O
the O
worst O
of O
it O
, O
you O
see O
... O
'' O
Cob I-PERSON
paused O
for O
effect O
, O
`` O
... O
cause O
the O
lamps O
on O
the O
wall O
were O
burning O
blue O
! O
'' O
Graham I-PERSON
, O
Jake I-PERSON
, O
and O
Shep I-PERSON
nodded O
to O
themselves O
. O
The O
three O
friends O
had O
grown O
up O
together O
, O
listening O
to O
Cob I-PERSON
's O
stories O
and O
ignoring O
his O
advice O
. O
Cob I-PERSON
peered O
closely O
at O
the O
newer O
, O
more O
attentive O
member O
of O
his O
small O
audience O
, O
the O
smith O
's O
prentice O
. O
`` O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
that O
meant O
, O
boy O
? O
'' O
Everyone O
called O
the O
smith O
's O
prentice O
`` O
boy O
'' O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
a O
hand O
taller O
than O
anyone O
there O
. O
Small O
towns O
being O
what O
they O
are O
, O
he O
would O
most O
likely O
remain O
`` O
boy O
'' O
until O
his O
beard O
filled O
out O
or O
he O
bloodied O
someone O
's O
nose O
over O
the O
matter O
. O
The O
boy O
gave O
a O
slow O
nod O
. O
`` O
The O
Chandrian O
. O
'' O
`` O
That O
's O
right O
, O
'' O
Cob I-PERSON
said O
approvingly O
. O
`` O
The O
Chandrian O
. O
Everyone O
knows O
that O
blue O
fire O
is O
one O
of O
their O
signs O

was O

`` O
But O
how O
'd O
they O
find O
him O

the O

interrupted O

`` O

why O

n't O
they O
kill O
him O
when O
they O
had O
the O
chance O

`` O
Hush O
now O
, O
you O
'll O
get O
all O
the O
answers O
before O
the O
end O

Jake O
said O
. O
`` O
Just O
let O
him O
tell O
it O
. O
'' O
`` O
No O
need O
for O
all O
that O
, O
Jake I-PERSON
, O
'' O
Graham I-PERSON
said O
. O
`` O
Boy O

just O
curious O
. O
Drink O
your O
drink O

'' O
`` O
I O
drank O
me O
drink O
already O

'' O
Jake I-PERSON
grumbled O
. O
`` O
I O
need O

other O
but O
the O
innkeep O
's O
still O
skinning O
rats O
in O
the O
back O
room O

'' O
He O
raised O
his O
voice O
and O
knocked O
his O
empty O
mug O
hollowly O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
mahogany O
bar O
. O
`` O
Hoy O
! O
We O
're O
thirsty O
men O
in O
here O

The O
innkeeper O
appeared O
with O
five O
bowls O
of O
stew O
and O
two O
warm O
, O
round O
loaves O
of O
bread O
. O
He O
pulled O
more O
beer O
for O
Jake O
, O
Shep I-PERSON
, O
and O
Old I-PERSON
Cob I-PERSON
, O
moving O
with O
an O
air O
of O
bustling O
efficiency O
. O
The O
story O
was O
set O
aside O
while O
the O
men O
tended O
to O
their O
dinners O
. O
Old I-PERSON
Cob I-PERSON
tucked O
away O
his O
bowl O
of O
stew O
with O
the O
predatory O
efficiency O
of O
a O
lifetime O
bachelor O
. O
The O
others O
were O
still O
blowing O
steam O
off O
their O
bowls O
when O
he O
finished O
the O
last O
of O
his O
loaf O
and O
returned O
to O
his O
story O
. O
`` O
Now O
Taborlin I-PERSON
needed O
to O
escape O
, O
but O
when O
he O
looked O
around O
, O
he O
saw O
his O
cell O
had O
no O
door O

No O
windows O

All O
around O
him O
was O
nothing O
but O
smooth O
, O
hard O
stone O

It O
was O
a O
cell O

man O
had O
ever O
escaped O

`` O
But O
Taborlin I-PERSON
knew O
the O
names O
of O
all O
things O
, O
and O
so O
all O
things O
were O
his O
to O
command O
. O
He O
said O
to O
the O
stone O
: O
` O
Break O
! O
' O
and O
the O
stone O
broke O
. O
The O
wall O
tore O
like O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
, O
and O
through O
that O
hole O
Taborlin I-PERSON
could O
see O
the O
sky O
and O
breathe O
the O
sweet O
spring O
air O
. O
He O
stepped O
to O
the O
edge O
, O
looked O
down O
, O
and O
without O
a O
second O
thought O
he O
stepped O
out O
into O
the O
open O
air O

'' O
The O
boy O
's O
eyes O
went O
wide O
. O
`` O
He O
did O
n't O
! O

Cob I-PERSON
nodded O
seriously O
. O
`` O
So O
Taborlin I-PERSON
fell O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
despair O
. O
For O
he O
knew O
the O
name O
of O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
so O
the O
wind O
obeyed O
him O
. O
He O
spoke O
to O
the O
wind O
and O
it O
cradled O
and O
caressed O
him O
. O
It O
bore O
him O
to O
the O
ground O
as O
gently O
as O
a O
puff O
of O
thistledown O
and O
set O
him O
on O
his O
feet O
softly O
as O
a O
mother O

kiss O

`` O
And O
when O
he O
got O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
felt O
his O
side O
where O
they O
'd O
stabbed O
him O
, O
he O
saw O
that O
it O
were O
n't O
hardly O
a O
scratch O

Now O
maybe O
it O
was O
just O
a O
piece O
of O
luck O

'' O
Cob I-PERSON
tapped O
the O
side O
of O
his O
nose O
knowingly O
. O
`` O
Or O
maybe O
it O
had O
something O
to O
do O

under O

'' O
`` O
What O
amulet O
? O

the O
boy O
asked O
eagerly O
through O
a O
mouthful O
of O
stew O

Old I-PERSON
Cob I-PERSON
leaned O
back O
on O
his O
stool O
, O
glad O
for O
the O
chance O
to O
elaborate O
. O
`` O
A O
few O
days O
earlier O

met O

even O
though O
Taborlin I-PERSON
did O

have O
much O

shared O

dinner O
with O
the O
old O
man O

`` O

up O
for O

that O
night O

`` O
Actually O

The O
men O
at O

almost O
surprised O

there O

been O
coming O

anything O

expect O
anything O

only O
been O
in O

the O
silence O

embarrassed O

Old I-PERSON

nodded O
before O
he O
cleared O
his O
throat O
and O
launched O
back O
into O
the O
story O

darkly O

out O

The O

fell O
further O

the O

clutched O

A O
moment O
of O
serious O
silence O
followed O
the O
news O

The O
smith O

prentice O
laid O
a O
sympathetic O
hand O
on O
Carter O

shoulder O

`` O

He O
looked O
around O

Cob I-PERSON
finally O
managed O
to O
free O
himself O
from O
Jake I-PERSON
. O
`` O
I O
told O
you O

he O
repeated O
, O
shaking O
a O
finger O
in O
Carter I-PERSON

direction O
. O
`` O
There O

out O

There O
was O
a O
moment O
of O
uncomfortable O
quiet O

Jake I-PERSON
and O
Cob I-PERSON
glared O
at O
each O
other O
while O
the O
rest O
seemed O
at O
a O
loss O
for O
words O
, O
unsure O
of O
how O
to O
comfort O
their O
friend O

The O
innkeeper O
moved O
carefully O
through O
the O
silence O
. O
Arms O
full O
, O
he O
stepped O
nimbly O
around O
Shep O
and O
began O
to O
arrange O
some O
items O
on O
a O
nearby O
table O
: O
a O
bowl O
of O
hot O
water O
, O
shears O

some O

quiet O
him O

him O
aside O

Carter I-PERSON

mouth O
made O
a O
thin O
line O
. O
He O
reached O
out O
and O
pulled O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bloody O
blanket O
. O
Whatever O
was O
inside O
flipped O
over O
once O
and O
snagged O
on O
the O
cloth O
. O
Carter I-PERSON
tugged O
harder O
and O
there O
was O
a O
clatter O
like O
a O
bag O
of O
flat O
river O
stones O
upended O
onto O
the O
tabletop O
. O
It O
was O
a O
spider O
as O
large O
as O
a O
wagon O
wheel O
, O
black O
as O
slate O

The O
smith O
's O
prentice O
jumped O
backward O
and O
hit O
a O
table O
, O
knocking O
it O
over O
and O
almost O
falling O
to O
the O
ground O
himself O

Cob I-PERSON

face O
went O
slack O

Graham I-PERSON
, O
Shep I-PERSON

and O
Jake I-PERSON
made O
wordless O
, O
startled O
sounds O
and O
moved O
away O
, O
raising O
their O
hands O
to O
their O
faces O
. O
Carter I-PERSON
took O
a O
step O
backward O
that O
was O
almost O
like O
a O
nervous O
twitch O
. O
Silence O
filled O
the O
room O
like O
a O
cold O
sweat O
. O
The O
innkeeper O
frowned O
. O
`` O
They O
ca O

made O
it O

he O
said O
softly O

If O
not O
for O
the O
silence O
, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
anyone O
would O
have O
heard O
him O

But O
they O
did O
. O
Their O
eyes O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
thing O
on O
the O
table O
to O
stare O
mutely O
at O
the O
red-haired O
man O
. O
Jake I-PERSON
found O
his O
voice O
first O
. O
`` O
You O
know O
what O
this O
is O

'' O
The O
innkeeper O

eyes O
were O
distant O

The O

up O
sharply O

`` O

No O

that O
he O

the O
only O
one O
within O

of O
the O

he O
took O
a O
measured O
step O
away O

at O

all O

reflexively O

repeating O
the O
complaint O

the O

nodded O

silent O
agreement O

seeming O
to O
find O

familiar O
words O

darkly O

went O
back O

looked O

leaned O
closer O

stretching O
out O

edged O
even O
farther O
away O
