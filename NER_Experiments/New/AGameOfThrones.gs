They O
set O
forth O
at O
daybreak O
to O
see O
a O
man O
beheaded O
, O
twenty O
in O
all O
, O
and O
Bran I-PERSON
rode O
among O
them O
, O
nervous O
with O
excitement O
. O
This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
he O
had O
been O
deemed O
old O
enough O
to O
go O
with O
his O
lord O
father O
and O
his O
brothers O
to O
see O
the O
king O
's O
justice O
done O
. O
It O
was O
the O
ninth O
year O
of O
summer O
, O
and O
the O
seventh O
of O
Bran I-PERSON
's O
life O
. O
The O
man O
had O
been O
taken O
outside O
a O
small O
holdfast O
in O
the O
hills O
. O
Robb I-PERSON
thought O
he O
was O
a O
wildling O
, O
his O
sword O
sworn O
to O
Mance I-PERSON
Rayder I-PERSON
, O
the O
King-beyond-the-Wall O
. O
It O
made O
Bran I-PERSON
's O
skin O
prickle O
to O
think O
of O
it O
. O
He O
remembered O
the O
hearth O
tales O
Old I-PERSON
Nan I-PERSON
told O
them O
. O
The O
wildlings O
were O
cruel O
men O
, O
she O
said O
, O
slavers O
and O
slayers O
and O
thieves O
. O
They O
consorted O
with O
giants O
and O
ghouls O
, O
stole O
girl O
children O
in O
the O
dead O
of O
night O
, O
and O
drank O
blood O
from O
polished O
horns O
. O
And O
their O
women O
lay O
with O
the O
Others O
in O
the O
Long O
Night O
to O
sire O
terrible O
half-human O
children O
. O
But O
the O
man O
they O
found O
bound O
hand O
and O
foot O
to O
the O
holdfast O
wall O
awaiting O
the O
king O
's O
justice O
was O
old O
and O
scrawny O
, O
not O
much O
taller O
than O
Robb I-PERSON
. O
He O
had O
lost O
both O
ears O
and O
a O
finger O
to O
frostbite O
, O
and O
he O
dressed O
all O
in O
black O
, O
the O
same O
as O
a O
brother O
of O
the O
Night O
's O
Watch O
, O
except O
that O
his O
furs O
were O
ragged O
and O
greasy O
. O
The O
breath O
of O
man O
and O
horse O
mingled O
, O
steaming O
, O
in O
the O
cold O
morning O
air O
as O
his O
lord I-PERSON
father O
had O
the O
man O
cut O
down O
from O
the O
wall O
and O
dragged O
before O
them O
. O
Robb I-PERSON
and O
Jon I-PERSON
sat O
tall O
and O
still O
on O
their O
horses O
, O
with O
Bran I-PERSON
between O
them O
on O
his O
pony O
, O
trying O
to O
seem O
older O
than O
seven O
, O
trying O
to O
pretend O
that O
he O
'd O
seen O
all O
this O
before O
. O
A O
faint O
wind O
blew O
through O
the O
holdfast O
gate O
. O
Over O
their O
heads O
flapped O
the O
banner O
of O
the O
Starks O
of O
Winterfell O
: O
a O
grey O
direwolf O
racing O
across O
an O
ice-white O
field O
. O
Bran I-PERSON
's O
father O
sat O
solemnly O
on O
his O
horse O
, O
long O
brown O
hair O
stirring O
in O
the O
wind O
. O
His O
closely O
trimmed O
beard O
was O
shot O
with O
white O
, O
making O
him O
look O
older O
than O
his O
thirty-five O
years O
. O
He O
had O
a O
grim O
cast O
to O
his O
grey O
eyes O
this O
day O
, O
and O
he O
seemed O
not O
at O
all O
the O
man O
who O
would O
sit O
before O
the O
fire O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
talk O
softly O
of O
the O
age O
of O
heroes O
and O
the O
children O
of O
the O
forest O
. O
He O
had O
taken O
off O
Father O
's O
face O
, O
Bran I-PERSON
thought O
, O
and O
donned O
the O
face O
of O
Lord I-PERSON
Stark I-PERSON
of O
Winterfell O
. O
There O
were O
questions O
asked O
and O
answers O
given O
there O
in O
the O
chill O
of O
morning O
, O
but O
afterward O
Bran I-PERSON
could O
not O
recall O
much O
of O
what O
had O
been O
said O
. O
Finally O
his O
lord O
father O
gave O
a O
command O
, O
and O
two O
of O
his O
guardsmen O
dragged O
the O
ragged O
man O
to O
the O
ironwood O
stump O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
square O
. O
They O
forced O
his O
head O
down O
onto O
the O
hard O
black O
wood O
. O
Lord I-PERSON
Eddard I-PERSON
Stark I-PERSON
dismounted O
and O
his O
ward O
Theon I-PERSON
Greyjoy I-PERSON
brought O
forth O
the O
sword O
. O
`` O
Ice O
, O
'' O
that O
sword O
was O
called O
. O
It O
was O
as O
wide O
across O
as O
a O
man O
's O
hand O
, O
and O
taller O
even O
than O
Robb I-PERSON
. O
The O
blade O
was O
Valyrian O
steel O
, O
spell-forged O
and O
dark O
as O
smoke O
. O
Nothing O
held O
an O
edge O
like O
Valyrian O
steel O
. O
His O
father O
peeled O
off O
his O
gloves O
and O
handed O
them O
to O
Jory I-PERSON
Cassel I-PERSON
, O
the O
captain O
of O
his O
household O
guard O
. O
He O
took O
hold O
of O
Ice O
with O
both O
hands O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

above O

Bran I-PERSON

Jon I-PERSON
Snow I-PERSON
moved O
closer O
. O
`` O
Keep O
the O

he O
whispered O

`` O

Bran I-PERSON
kept O
his O

well O
in O

did O
not O
look O
away O

His O
father O
took O
off O
the O
man O

head O
with O
a O
single O
sure O
stroke O
. O
Blood O
sprayed O
out O
across O
the O
snow O
, O
as O
red O
as O

. O
One O
of O
the O
horses O
reared O

to O
be O
restrained O
to O
keep O
from O
bolting O

Bran I-PERSON
could O
not O
take O
his O
eyes O
off O
the O
blood O
. O
The O
snows O
around O
the O
stump O
drank O
it O
eagerly O
, O
reddening O
as O
he O
watched O
. O
The O
head O
bounced O
off O
a O
thick O
root O
and O
rolled O
. O
It O
came O
up O
near O
Greyjoy I-PERSON

feet O

Theon I-PERSON
was O
a O
lean O
, O
dark O
youth O
of O
nineteen O
who O
found O
everything O
amusing O

He O
laughed O
, O
put O
his O
boot O
on O
the O
head O

kicked O
it O
away O

`` O

Jon I-PERSON

, O
low O
enough O
so O
Greyjoy I-PERSON
did O
not O
hear O

He O
put O
a O
hand O
on O
Bran I-PERSON

shoulder O

Bran I-PERSON
looked O
over O
at O
his O
bastard O

`` O
You O

Jon I-PERSON
told O
him O
solemnly O

Jon I-PERSON

fourteen O

an O
old O

It O
seemed O
colder O
on O
the O
long O
ride O
back O
to O
Winterfell O
, O
though O
the O
wind O
had O
died O
by O
then O
and O
the O
sun O
was O
higher O
in O
the O
sky O

Bran I-PERSON
rode O
with O
his O
brothers O

well O
ahead O
of O
the O
main O
party O

his O
pony O

hard O
to O
keep O
up O
with O

`` O

grey O

there O

of O
an O
age O

they O
did O
not O
look O
alike O

Jon I-PERSON

slender O
where O

muscular O
, O
dark O
where O
Robb I-PERSON
was O
fair O
, O
graceful O
and O
quick O
where O
his O
half O

strong O

not O
impressed O

kicking O
his O
horse O
forward O

cursed O

followed O

they O
galloped O
off O
down O
the O
trail O
, O
Robb I-PERSON
laughing O
and O
hooting O
, O
Jon I-PERSON
silent O
and O
intent O
. O
The O
hooves O
of O
their O
horses O
kicked O
up O
showers O

as O
they O
went O

Bran I-PERSON
did O
not O
try O

pony O

up O

He O
had O
seen O
the O

After O
a O
while O

the O
sound O
of O
Robb I-PERSON

laughter O
receded O
, O

the O
woods O
grew O
silent O
again O

So O
deep O
in O
thought O
was O
he O
that O
he O
never O
heard O
the O
rest O
of O

his O

up O

him O

asked O

not O
unkindly O

up O

mounted O

He O
would O
have O
spurred O
the O

his O
father O
made O
them O
dismount O
beside O
the O
bridge O
and O
approach O
on O
foot O
. O
Bran I-PERSON
jumped O
off O
and O
ran O
. O
By O
then O
Jon I-PERSON
, O
Jory I-PERSON

Theon I-PERSON
Greyjoy I-PERSON
had O
all O
dismounted O
as O
well O

Greyjoy I-PERSON

`` O

at O
the O

Bran I-PERSON
's O
heart O
was O
thumping O
in O
his O
chest O
as O
he O
pushed O
through O
a O
waist-high O
drift O
to O
his O
brothers O
' O
side O
. O
Half-buried O
in O
bloodstained O
snow O
, O
a O
huge O
dark O
shape O
slumped O
in O
death O
. O
Ice O
had O
formed O
in O
its O
shaggy O
grey O
fur O
, O
and O
the O
faint O
smell O
of O
corruption O
clung O
to O
it O
like O
a O
woman O

perfume O
. O
Bran O
glimpsed O
blind O
eyes O
crawling O
with O
maggots O
, O
a O
wide O
mouth O
full O
of O
yellowed O
teeth O
. O
But O
it O
was O
the O
size O
of O
it O
that O
made O
him O
gasp O
. O
It O
was O
bigger O
than O
his O
pony O
, O
twice O
the O
size O
of O
the O
largest O
hound O
in O
his O
father O
's O
kennel O

calmly O

Jon I-PERSON

Bran I-PERSON
tore O
his O
eyes O
away O
from O

That O
was O
when O
he O
noticed O
the O
bundle O
in O
Robb I-PERSON

He O
gave O
a O
cry O
of O
delight O

moved O
closer O

The O
pup O
was O
a O
tiny O
ball O
of O
grey-black O
fur O
, O
its O
eyes O
still O
closed O

It O
nuzzled O
blindly O
against O

chest O
as O
he O
cradled O
it O
, O
searching O
for O
milk O

a O
sad O
little O

sound O

reached O
out O
hesitantly O

`` O

Robb I-PERSON
told O
him O

`` O
You O

Bran I-PERSON
gave O
the O
pup O
a O
quick O
nervous O
stroke O

then O
turned O
as O
Jon I-PERSON
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
you O
go O

His O
half O

put O
a O

`` O
There O

Bran I-PERSON
sat O
down O
in O
the O
snow O

hugged O
the O
wolf O

to O
his O
face O

Its O
fur O
was O
soft O

warm O
against O
his O
cheek O

`` O

asked O

His O

knelt O

groped O
under O
the O

with O
his O
hand O

He O
gave O
a O
yank O

held O
it O
up O

A O
foot O

off O

all O

A O
sudden O
silence O
descended O
over O
the O

The O

looked O
at O
the O

uneasily O

no O

could O
sense O

His O
father O
tossed O
the O

to O
the O
side O

cleansed O

in O
the O
snow O
