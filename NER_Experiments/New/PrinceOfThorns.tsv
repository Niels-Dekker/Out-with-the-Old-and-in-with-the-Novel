|Always the ravens . |										
|They settled on the gables of the church even before the injured became the dead . |										
|Even before Rike had finished taking fingers from hands , and rings from fingers . |	Brother Rike									
|I leaned back against the gallowspost and nodded to the birds , a dozen of them in a black line , wise-eyed and watching . |	DEFAULT									
|The town-square ran red . |										
|Blood in the gutters , blood on the flagstones , blood in the fountain . |										
|The corpses posed as corpses do . |										
|Some comical , reaching for the sky with missing fingers , some peaceful , coiled about their wounds . |										
|Flies rose above the wounded as they struggled . |										
|This way and that , some blind , some sly , all betrayed by their buzzing entourage . |										
|`` Water ! |										
|Water ! '' |										
|It 's always water with the dying . |										
|Strange , it 's killing that gives me a thirst . |	DEFAULT									
|And that was Mabberton . |										
|Two hundred dead farmers lying with their scythes and axes . |										
|You know , I warned them that we do this for a living . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I said it to their leader , Bovid Tor . |	DEFAULT	Bovid								
|I gave them that chance , I always do . |	DEFAULT									
|But no . |										
|They wanted blood and slaughter . |										
|And they got it . |										
|War , my friends , is a thing of beauty . |										
|Those as says otherwise are losing . |										
|If I 'd bothered to go over to old Bovid , propped up against the fountain with his guts in his lap , he 'd probably take a contrary view . |	Bovid	DEFAULT								
|But look where disagreeing got him . |	Bovid									
|`` Shit-poor farm maggots . '' |										
|Rike discarded a handful of fingers over Bovid 's open belly . |	Brother Rike	Bovid								
|He came to me , holding out his takings , as if it was my fault . |	Brother Rike	DEFAULT								
|`` Look ! |										
|One gold ring . |										
|One ! |										
|A whole village and one fecking gold ring . |										
|I 'd like to set the bastards up and knock â€™em down again . |	DEFAULT									
|Fecking bog-farmers . '' |										
|He would too : he was an evil bastard , and greedy with it . |	DEFAULT									
|I held his eye . |	Brother Rike	DEFAULT								
|`` Settle down , Brother Rike . |	Brother Rike									
|There 's more than one kind of gold in Mabberton . '' |										
|I gave him my warning look . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|His cursing stole the magic from the scene ; besides , I had to be stern with him . |	Brother Rike	DEFAULT								
|Rike was always on the edge after a battle , wanting more . |	Brother Rike									
|I gave him a look that told him I had more . |	Brother Rike	DEFAULT								
|More than he could handle . |	DEFAULT									
|He grumbled , stowed his bloody ring , and thrust his knife back in his belt . |	Makin									
|Makin came up then and flung an arm about each of us , clapping gauntlet to shoulder-plate . |	Makin									
|If Makin had a skill , then smoothing things over was it . |	Makin									
|`` Brother Jorg is right , Little Rikey . |	Brother Rike	Jorg								
|There 's treasure aplenty to be found . '' |										
|He was wont to call Rike `` Little Rikey , '' on account of him being a head taller than any of us and twice as wide . |	Brother Rike									
|Makin always told jokes . |	Makin									
|He 'd tell them to those as he killed , if they gave him time . |	Makin									
|Liked to see them go out with a smile . |										
|`` What treasure ? '' |										
|Rike wanted to know , still surly . |	Brother Rike									
|`` When you get farmers , what else do you always get , Little Rikey ? '' |	Brother Rike									
|Makin raised his eyebrows all suggestive . |	Makin									
|Rike lifted his visor , treating us to his ugly face . |	Brother Rike									
|Well , brutal more than ugly . |										
|I think the scars improved him . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Cows ? '' |										
|Makin pursed his lips . |	Makin									
|I never liked his lips , too thick and fleshy , but I forgave him that , for his joking and his deathly work with that flail of his . |	Makin	Brother Rike								
|`` Well , you can have the cows , Little Rikey . |	Brother Rike									
|Me , I 'm going to find a farmer 's daughter or three , before the others use them all up . '' |	DEFAULT									
|They went off then , Rike doing that laugh of his , `` hur , hur , hur , '' as if he was trying to cough a fishbone out . |	Brother Rike									
|I watched them force the door to Bovid 's place opposite the church , a fine house , high roofed with wooden slates and a little flower garden in front . |	Bovid									
|Bovid followed them with his eyes , but he could n't turn his head . |	Bovid									
|I looked at the ravens , I watched Gemt and his half-wit brother , Maical , taking heads , Maical with the cart and Gemt with the axe . |	DEFAULT	Gemt	Maical							
|A thing of beauty , I tell you . |	DEFAULT									
|At least to look at . |										
|I 'll agree war smells bad . |	DEFAULT									
|But we 'd torch the place soon enough and the stink would all turn to wood-smoke . |										
|Gold rings ? |										
|I needed no more payment . |	DEFAULT									
|`` Boy ! '' |	DEFAULT									
|Bovid called out , his voice all hollow like , and weak . |	Bovid									
|I went to stand before him , leaning on my sword , tired in my arms and legs all of a sudden . |	Bovid	DEFAULT								
|`` Best speak your piece quickly , farmer . |	DEFAULT									
|Brother Gemt 's a-coming with his axe . |	Gemt									
|Chop-chop . '' |										
|He did n't seem too worried . |	DEFAULT									
|It 's hard to worry a man so close to the worm-feast . |										
|Still , it irked me that he held me so lightly and called me `` boy . '' |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Do you have daughters , farmer ? |	DEFAULT									
|Hiding in the cellar maybe ? |										
|Old Rike will sniff them out . '' |	Brother Rike									
|Bovid looked up sharp at that , pained and sharp . |	Bovid									
|`` H-how old are you , boy ? '' |	DEFAULT									
|Again the `` boy . '' |										
|`` Old enough to slit you open like a fat purse , '' I said , getting angry now . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I do n't like to get angry . |	DEFAULT									
|It makes me angry . |	DEFAULT									
|I do n't think he caught even that . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|I do n't think he even knew it was me that opened him up not half an hour before . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Fifteen summers , no more . |										
|Could n't be more ... '' His words came slow , from blue lips in a white face . |	DEFAULT									
|Out by two , I would have told him , but he 'd gone past hearing . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|The cart creaked up behind me , and Gemt came along with his axe dripping . |	DEFAULT	Gemt								
|`` Take his head , '' I told them . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Leave his fat belly for the ravens . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Fifteen ! |										
|I 'd hardly be fifteen and rousting villages . |	DEFAULT									
|By the time fifteen came around , I 'd be King ! |	DEFAULT									
|Some people are born to rub you the wrong way . |										
|Brother Gemt was born to rub the world the wrong way . |	Gemt
