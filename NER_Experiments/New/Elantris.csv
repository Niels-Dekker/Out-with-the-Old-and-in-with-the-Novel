0.530058155284651	212	|He was covered with slime , and the raw stench of Elantris now rose from him as well . |	|`` Duladel is of mixed blood , sule . |	|Arelish , Fjordell , Teoish -- you 'll find them all . |	1	Duladen									
0.554005706594267	363	|`` The way I see it , '' Raoden said , moving to tuck the meat back in his sash , `` the only food that ever enters this place arrives with the newcomers . |	|One must get pretty hungry with so few offerings and so many mouths to feed . |	|One would think the hunger would be almost maddening . '' |	0										
0.347121004125833	57	|The dawn 's light had grown just strong enough for him to see the reflection that stared back at him . |	|A stranger 's reflection . |	|His blue eyes were the same , though they were wide with terror . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.179519985739234	152	|Raoden left the boy behind , turning to continue down the small street . |	|He had hoped that the city would grow less gruesome as he left the main courtyard -- thinking , perhaps , that the dirt was a result of the area 's relatively frequent use . |	|He had been wrong ; the alley was covered with just as much filth as the courtyard , if not more . |	1	Raoden									
0.819228933705569	132	|The stench was almost overwhelming . |	|The omnipresent sludge had a musty , rotten scent , like that of dying fungus . |	|Raoden was so bothered by the smell that he nearly stepped directly on the gnarled form of an old man huddled next to a building 's wall . |	0										
0.915238202927459	310	|`` I need your help , Galladon , '' Raoden said , squatting on the ground in front of the steps . |	|Galladon snorted . |	|`` This is Elantris , sule . |	1	Galladon

0.697015496489229	47	|The tray dropped to the ground with a crash , slipping from the stunned maid 's fingers even as Raoden reached out to accept it . |	|Raoden froze , the tray 's metallic ring echoing through the silent morning hallway . |	|`` Merciful Domi ! '' |	1	Raoden									
0.889763390262888	31	|Almost ravenous . |	|He had never liked large breakfasts , but this morning he found himself waiting impatiently for his meal to arrive . |	|Finally , he decided to send someone to see what was taking so long . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.893000052316261	78	|Its high walls were lined with guardhouses and soldiers -- men intended not to keep enemies out of the city , but to keep its inhabitants from escaping . |	|Since the Reod , every person taken by the Shaod had been thrown into Elantris to rot ; the fallen city had become an expansive tomb for those whose bodies had forgotten how to die . |	|Raoden could remember standing on those walls , looking down on Elantris 's dread inhabitants , just as the guards now looked down on him . |	0										
0.570206311169813	154	|He had been wrong ; the alley was covered with just as much filth as the courtyard , if not more . |	|A muffled thump sounded from behind . |	|Raoden turned with surprise . |	0

0.303344395861883	262	|`` We could try burning him , assuming we could make a fire . |	|Elantrian bodies seem to burn better than those of regular people , and some think that 's a fitting death for our kind . '' |	|`` And ... '' Raoden said , still unable to look at the boy . |	0										
0.408866079000366	200	|Kolo ? '' |	|`` Kolo . '' |	|The foreign word was vaguely familiar , as was the man 's strong accent . |	0

0.775266413911872	170	|Desperate , Raoden tossed the sacrificial basket over his head . |	|The awkward motion threw him off balance , and an unseen schism in the cobblestones sent him into a maladroit skip that did n't end until he collided with a rotting mass of wood . |	|The wood -- which might once have been a pile of crates -- squished , breaking his fall . |	1	Raoden									
0.59304535981909	40	|Resting in the great city 's shadow , Kae seemed like an insignificant village by comparison . |	|Elantris . |	|An enormous , ebony block -- not really a city anymore , just the corpse of one . |	0										
0.822593444285039	138	|The creature 's soot-covered skin was dark and spotted , but his face was that of a child , not a man . |	|Raoden took an involuntary step backward . |	|The boy , as if realizing that his chance would soon pass , stretched his arm forward with the sudden strength of desperation . |	1	Raoden									
0.011185381703869	375	|Then , though his hand jerked reflexively toward his mouth , he stopped . |	|With a careful motion he tucked the meat into a pocket and stood up . |	|`` So , what should I call you ? '' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.268502572127857	318	|`` Your actions speak much more convincingly than your words . '' |	|`` Perhaps I simply have n't tried to hurt you because I know you do n't have anything to take . '' |	|`` I do n't believe that . '' |	2	DEFAULT	DEFAULT

0.46719939422185	297	|The large , dark-skinned man walked back the way they had come , passing the occasional moaning body in a gutter , his back turned toward Raoden with a posture of complete indifference . |	|Watching the Dula go , Raoden tried to gather his thoughts . |	|He had been trained for a life in politics ; years of preparation had conditioned him to make quick decisions . |	1	Raoden									
0.165072612905912	236	|We 're either very careful , or we end up like those rulos you saw in the courtyard . '' |	|`` In the courtyard ... . |	|Idos Domi ! '' |	0										
0.599303782858546	372	|Fortunately , I was n't planning any extended trips during the next month . '' |	|Raoden tossed him the meat with a laugh . |	|Galladon snatched the meat . |	2	Raoden	Galladon

0.893987719730387	117	|He could n't make out much from their silhouetted forms , but they seemed to be waiting for something . |	|He could feel their eyes on him . |	|Raoden raised an arm to shade his eyes , and only then did he remember the small thatch basket in his hands . |	1	Raoden									
0.17461045426853	182	|The thug paused . |	|A second later , a cry of joy from behind drew his attention : one of the others had located the tiny skin of wine . |	|The struggle that ensued apparently drove all thoughts of Raoden from the men 's minds , and the five were soon gone -- four chasing after the one who had been fortunate , or foolish , enough to escape with the precious liquor . |	1	Raoden									
0.306753579895056	111	|Raoden suspected they would soon be indistinguishable from the other Elantrians ' garb . |	|This is what I will become , Raoden thought . |	|It has already begun . |	1	Raoden									
0.667101576275212	70	|Ten years ago , the Shaod would have made Raoden a god . |	|Now , instead of making people into silver-skinned deities , it changed them into sickly monstrosities . |	|Raoden shook his head in disbelief . |	0										
0.600322757697065	302	|There was something innately likable about the Dula , something Raoden found indefinably appealing , even if it was covered by a grime of pessimism as thick as the slime on the ground . |	|It was more than Galladon 's lucidity , more than just his leisurely attitude . |	|Raoden had seen the man 's eyes when he regarded the suffering child . |	1	Galladon									
0.819679819531385	344	|`` What makes you think I wo n't simply attack you and take it ? '' |	|The words were not hypothetical ; Raoden could tell that a part of Galladon was actually considering such an action . |	|How large a part was still indeterminable . |	2	Raoden	Galladon								
0.35388006780036	202	|The foreign word was vaguely familiar , as was the man 's strong accent . |	|`` You 're not from Arelon ? '' |	|The man shook his head . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.52665682798996	71	|Now , instead of making people into silver-skinned deities , it changed them into sickly monstrosities . |	|Raoden shook his head in disbelief . |	|The Shaod was a thing that happened to other people -- distant people . |	1	Raoden									
0.287636687546651	245	|The boy tried without success to breathe through the mess . |	|Suddenly Raoden 's toe did n't seem so bad . |	|`` Idos Domi ... '' Raoden whispered , turning his head as his stomach lurched . |	1	Raoden									
0.418795514901692	334	|A piece of dried meat . |	|Galladon 's eyes opened all the way , his face changing from bored to interested . |	|There was a glint in his eyes -- a bit of the same wildness that Raoden had seen in the savage men earlier . |	1	Galladon									
0.255820650011238	21	|Just outside his open balcony windows he could see the enormous city of Elantris in the distance , its stark walls casting a deep shadow over the smaller city of Kae , where Raoden lived . |	|Elantris 's walls were incredibly high , but Raoden could see the tops of black towers rising behind them , their broken spires a clue to the fallen majesty hidden within . |	|The abandoned city seemed darker than usual . |	1	Raoden									
0.81805681075648	294	|To many , an existence of agony is better than no existence at all . '' |	|So , they left the boy where he had fallen -- Galladon doing so without a second thought , Raoden following because he could n't think of anything else to do , though he felt the pain of guilt more sharply than even the pain in his toe . |	|Galladon obviously did n't care whether Raoden followed him , went in another direction , or stood staring at an interesting spot of grime on the wall . |	3	Raoden	Galladon	DEFAULT							
0.160984529904472	240	|He found the beggar boy in the same location , near the mouth of the alley . |	|He was still alive ... in a way . |	|The boy 's eyes stared blankly into the air , the pupils quivering . |	1	DEFAULT

0.686399061851779	135	|The man moaned piteously , reaching up with a thin arm . |	|Raoden looked down , and felt a sudden chill . |	|The `` old man '' was no more than sixteen years old . |	1	Raoden									
0.420283970220659	242	|The boy 's eyes stared blankly into the air , the pupils quivering . |	|His lips worked silently , no sound escaping . |	|The boy 's neck had been completely crushed , and there was a massive gash in its side , exposing the vertebrae and throat . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.452423103732265	165	|Raoden scrambled away in fear -- something that , as a prince , he had never needed to do before . |	|He ran madly , expecting his breath to run short and a pain to stab him in the side , as usually happened when he overextended himself . |	|Neither occurred . |	1	Raoden									
0.600781896718521	28	|It was unusually warm for such an early hour ; he did n't feel even a bit chilly as he threw on his robe , then pulled the servant 's cord beside his bed , indicating that he wanted breakfast . |	|That was another odd thing . |	|He was hungry -- very hungry . |	0										
0.042211944193019	185	|Raoden sat in the debris , overwhelmed . |	|This is what you will become ... . |	|`` Looks like they forgot about you , sule , '' a voice observed . |	1	Raoden									
0.73496252515023	249	|`` There is n't much left for this one , '' Galladon said with a matter-of-fact tone , crouching down next to the beggar . |	|`` How ... ? '' |	|Raoden began , then stopped as his stomach threatened him again . |	0										
0.562988931504337	116	|Some Elantrians were crouching in a shadowed doorway across from him . |	|He could n't make out much from their silhouetted forms , but they seemed to be waiting for something . |	|He could feel their eyes on him . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.97051792174162	160	|Eventually , one of the newcomers -- obviously annoyed -- brought a makeshift club down on the boy 's head with a crunch that resounded through the small alley . |	|The men finished the bread , then turned to regard Raoden . |	|He took an apprehensive step backward ; it appeared that he had been hasty in assuming he had n't been followed . |	1	Raoden									
0.201570923079437	227	|Raoden flopped to the ground next to Galladon 's steps . |	|His toe continued to hurt with a pain as sharp as the moment he stubbed it . |	|`` Every pain , sule , '' Galladon whispered . |	1	Raoden									
0.954537980826117	143	|`` Please ? '' |	|Then the arm fell , its endurance expended , and the body slumped back against the cold stone wall . |	|His eyes , however , continued to watch Raoden . |	0										
0.502751280396162	101	|Many sat uncaringly , or unknowingly , in pools of dark water , the remains of the night 's rainstorm . |	|And they were moaning . |	|Most of them were quiet about it , mumbling to themselves or whimpering with some unseen pain . |	0										
0.434127174830761	113	|It has already begun . |	|In a few weeks I will be nothing more than a dejected body , a corpse whimpering in the corner . |	|A slight motion on the other side of the courtyard brought Raoden out of his self-pity . |	1	Raoden									
0.028174148413708	258	|The boy will stay like this forever . |	|That is , after all , the typical length of eternal damnation . '' |	|`` Is there nothing we can do ? '' |	0										
0.092847606168236	197	|I was beginning to think everyone in here was either dying or insane . '' |	|`` We ca n't be dying , '' the man responded with a snort . |	|`` We 're already dead . |	1	DEFAULT									
0.945200168492305	309	|`` What ? '' |	|`` I need your help , Galladon , '' Raoden said , squatting on the ground in front of the steps . |	|Galladon snorted . |	2	Raoden	Galladon								
0.687509536766282	164	|Sounds of pursuit came from behind . |	|Raoden scrambled away in fear -- something that , as a prince , he had never needed to do before . |	|He ran madly , expecting his breath to run short and a pain to stab him in the side , as usually happened when he overextended himself . |	1	Raoden									
0.969686516319054	336	|There was a glint in his eyes -- a bit of the same wildness that Raoden had seen in the savage men earlier . |	|It was more controlled , but it was there . |	|For the first time , Raoden realized just how much he was gambling on his first impression of the Dula . |	0										
0.544244514764811	55	|What had been hidden in the shadows of his darkened room was now illuminated by the hallway 's flickering lantern . |	|Raoden turned , throwing furniture out of his way as he stumbled to the tall mirror at the side of his chambers . |	|The dawn 's light had grown just strong enough for him to see the reflection that stared back at him . |	1	Raoden									
0.20565930031898	314	|Pain , insanity , and a whole lot of slime are the only things you 'll find here . '' |	|`` You almost sound like you believe that . '' |	|`` You are asking in the wrong place , sule . '' |	1	DEFAULT									
0.008245585412826	66	|Raoden slumped against it , thoughts numbed by the day 's events . |	|It was as if his memories belonged to another person . |	|His father , King Iadon , had n't met Raoden 's gaze as he ordered the priests to prepare his son and throw him into Elantris . |	1	Raoden									
0.7761534400439	26	|It was painful to remember the city 's beauty , to wonder how ten years ago the blessing of the Shaod had become a curse instead ... . |	|Raoden shook his head , climbing out of bed . |	|It was unusually warm for such an early hour ; he did n't feel even a bit chilly as he threw on his robe , then pulled the servant 's cord beside his bed , indicating that he wanted breakfast . |	1	Raoden									
0.968029925012489	235	|`` We do n't . |	|We 're either very careful , or we end up like those rulos you saw in the courtyard . '' |	|`` In the courtyard ... . |	0

0.499135941892844	193	|Tall and firm-framed , the man had wide hands and keen eyes set in a dark-skinned face . |	|He studied Raoden with a thoughtful attitude . |	|Raoden breathed a sigh of relief . |	2	Raoden	DEFAULT								
0.51422299125165	217	|`` What is it , sule ? |	|Get a splinter in the wrong place ? |	|There are n't many right places for that , I suppose . '' |	0										
0.03197006585483	332	|From the looks in the eyes of those men who attacked me , I 'd guess the hunger only gets worse . '' |	|Raoden reached under his grime-stained sacrificial robe , pulling out a thin object and holding it up for Galladon to see . |	|A piece of dried meat . |	2	Raoden	Galladon								
0.390014808622148	121	|The basket contained a loaf of bread , a few thin vegetables , a handful of grain , and a small flask of wine . |	|Normal death sacrifices were far more extensive , but even a victim of the Shaod had to be given something . |	|Raoden glanced back at the figures in the doorway , his mind flashing to rumors he 'd heard on the outside -- stories of Elantrian brutality . |	0										
0.382985447764587	123	|Raoden glanced back at the figures in the doorway , his mind flashing to rumors he 'd heard on the outside -- stories of Elantrian brutality . |	|The shadowed figures had yet to move , but their study of him was unnerving . |	|Taking a deep breath , Raoden took a step to the side , moving along the city wall toward the east side of the courtyard . |	1	Raoden									
0.134559436760168	33	|Finally , he decided to send someone to see what was taking so long . |	|`` Ien ? '' |	|he called in the unlit chambers . |	1	Ien									
0.019339286164765	353	|The Dula suddenly bellowed a deep , resounding laugh . |	|`` You speak Duladen , sule ? '' |	|`` Only a few words , '' Raoden said modestly . |	1	Raoden									
0.814601138558529	239	|Raoden pulled himself to his feet and hobbled toward the courtyard . |	|He found the beggar boy in the same location , near the mouth of the alley . |	|He was still alive ... in a way . |	2	Raoden	DEFAULT								
0.054508109242325	128	|Raoden released his breath , feeling that he had escaped something , though he did n't know what . |	|After a few moments , he was certain that no one followed , and he began to feel foolish for his alarm . |	|So far , he had yet to see anything that corroborated the rumors about Elantris . |	1	Raoden									
0.749690654462977	174	|His assailants , however , were no longer concerned with him . |	|The five men crouched in the street 's muck , picking scattered vegetables and grain off the cobblestones and out of the dark pools . |	|Raoden felt his stomach churn as one of the men slid his finger down a crack , scraped up a dark handful that was more sludge than corn , then rammed the entire mass between eager lips . |	0										
0.174488260455379	251	|Raoden began , then stopped as his stomach threatened him again . |	|He sat down in the slime with a plop and , after a few deep breaths , continued . |	|`` How long will he live like that ? '' |	1	Raoden									
0.800426818920313	343	|Galladon did n't answer for a moment . |	|`` What makes you think I wo n't simply attack you and take it ? '' |	|The words were not hypothetical ; Raoden could tell that a part of Galladon was actually considering such an action . |	2	Raoden	Galladon								
0.859220162500944	253	|`` How long will he live like that ? '' |	|`` You still do n't understand , sule , '' Galladon said , his accented voice sorrowful . |	|`` He is n't alive -- none of us are . |	2	Galladon	DEFAULT								
0.361163196773802	250	|`` How ... ? '' |	|Raoden began , then stopped as his stomach threatened him again . |	|He sat down in the slime with a plop and , after a few deep breaths , continued . |	1	Raoden									
0.583642414350617	378	|Raoden paused . |	|Probably best if people do n't know I 'm royalty , for now . |	|``` Sule ' works just fine for me . '' |	1	Raoden									
0.038274798177086	109	|They were long and flowing , like ribbons sewn together into a loose robe . |	|The linen on his arms and legs was already stained with grime from brushing up against the city gate and stone pillars . |	|Raoden suspected they would soon be indistinguishable from the other Elantrians ' garb . |	1	Raoden									
0.072031244113267	271	|Will the pain stop if he is burned ? '' |	|Galladon looked down at the boy . |	|Eventually , he just shrugged . |	2	Galladon	DEFAULT								
0.678585473355613	133	|The omnipresent sludge had a musty , rotten scent , like that of dying fungus . |	|Raoden was so bothered by the smell that he nearly stepped directly on the gnarled form of an old man huddled next to a building 's wall . |	|The man moaned piteously , reaching up with a thin arm . |	1	Raoden									
0.931829430276606	37	|Raoden frowned slightly at the Seon 's absence . |	|Where could Ien be ? |	|Raoden stood , and as he did , his eyes fell on Elantris again . |	1	Ien									
0.053805242229877	77	|The city of Elantris stretched out before him . |	|Its high walls were lined with guardhouses and soldiers -- men intended not to keep enemies out of the city , but to keep its inhabitants from escaping . |	|Since the Reod , every person taken by the Shaod had been thrown into Elantris to rot ; the fallen city had become an expansive tomb for those whose bodies had forgotten how to die . |	0

0.994084974475516	367	|`` Thirty , Galladon . |	|If you wo n't help me , someone else will . '' |	|Galladon ground his teeth for a moment . |	2	Galladon	DEFAULT								
0.624097506638053	91	|The Shaod had taken his body . |	|He could n't let it take his mind as well . |	|So , using his pride like a shield against despair , dejection , and -- most important -- self-pity , Raoden raised his head to stare damnation in the eyes . |	1	Raoden
