|It was barely an hour since they 'd routed the Khalidorans , when the monstrous ferali forged to devour Cenaria 's army had turned instead on its Khalidoran masters . |										
|Logan had issued the orders that seemed most pressing , then dismissed everyone to join the revelries that were sweeping the Cenarian camp . |										
|Terah Graesin came to him alone . |										
|He was sitting on a low rock , heedless of the mud . |	DEFAULT									
|His fine clothes were so spattered with blood and worse they were a total loss anyway . |	DEFAULT									
|Terah 's dress , by contrast , was clean except for the lower fringe . |	Terah Graesin									
|She wore high shoes , but even those could n't keep her entirely free of the thick mud . |	Terah Graesin									
|She stopped before him . |										
|He did n't stand . |										
|She pretended not to notice . |	DEFAULT									
|He pretended not to notice that her bodyguards -- unbloodied from battle -- were hidden in the trees less than a hundred paces away . |	DEFAULT	Terah Graesin								
|Terah Graesin could have only one reason to come to him : she was wondering if she was still the queen . |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|If Logan had n't been so bone-weary , he would have been amused . |	Logan									
|Terah had come to him alone as a show of vulnerability or fearlessness . |										
|`` You were a hero today , '' Terah said . |										
|`` You stopped the Godking 's beast . |	DEFAULT									
|They 're saying you killed him . '' |	Logan	DEFAULT								
|Logan shook his head . |	Logan									
|He 'd stabbed the ferali , and then the Godking had left it , but other men had given it more grievous wounds than he had . |	Logan	DEFAULT								
|Something else had stopped the Godking , not Logan . |										
|`` You commanded it to destroy our enemies , and it did . |										
|You saved Cenaria . '' |	Logan									
|Logan shrugged . |	Logan									
|It already seemed long ago . |										
|`` I guess the question is , '' Terah Graesin said , `` did you save Cenaria for yourself , or for all of us ? '' |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|Logan spat at her feet . |										
|`` Do n't give me that horseshit , Terah . |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|You think you 're going to manipulate me ? |	Terah Graesin									
|You 've got nothing to offer , nothing to threaten . |	DEFAULT									
|You 've got a question for me ? |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|Have a little respect and just fucking ask . '' |										
|Terah 's back stiffened , her chin lifted , and one hand twitched , but then she stopped . |	Terah Graesin									
|It was the hand twitch that captured Logan 's attention . |										
|If she had raised her hand , was that the sign for her men to attack ? |										
|Logan looked past her into the woods at the edge of the field , but the first thing he saw was n't her men . |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|He saw his own . |	Logan									
|Agon 's Dogs -- including two of the astoundingly talented archers Agon had armed with Ymmuri bows and made wytch hunters -- had stealthily circled behind Terah 's bodyguards . |										
|Both wytch hunters had arrows nocked , but not drawn . |										
|Both men had obviously taken care to stand where Logan could see them clearly , because none of the other Dogs were clearly visible . |										
|One archer was alternately looking at Logan and at a target in the woods . |										
|Logan followed his eyes and saw Terah 's hidden archer , aiming at Logan , waiting for Terah 's signal . |										
|The other wytch hunter was staring at Terah Graesin 's back . |	Terah Graesin	DEFAULT								
|They were waiting for Logan 's signal . |	Logan									
|Logan should have known his streetwise followers would n't leave him alone when Terah Graesin was near . |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|He looked at Terah . |										
|She was slim , pretty , with imperious green eyes that reminded Logan of his mother 's . |										
|Terah thought Logan did n't know about her men in the woods . |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|She thought Logan did n't know that she had the stronger hand . |										
|`` You swore fealty to me this morning under less than ideal circumstances , '' Terah said . |										
|`` Do you intend to keep your troth , or do you intend to make yourself king ? '' |										
|She could n't ask the question straight , could she ? |	DEFAULT									
|It just was n't in her , not even when she thought she had total control over Logan . |	DEFAULT	Logan								
|She would not make a good queen . |	DEFAULT									
|Logan thought he 'd already made his decision , but he hesitated . |	Logan									
|He remembered how it felt to be powerless in the Hole , how it felt to be powerless when Jenine , his just-wed wife , had been murdered . |	Logan	Jenine								
|He remembered how disconcertingly wonderful it felt to tell Kylar to kill Gorkhy and see it done . |	DEFAULT	Kylar	Gorkhy							
|He wondered if he would feel the same pleasure at seeing Terah Graesin die . |	Terah Graesin	DEFAULT								
|With one nod toward those wytch hunters , he would find out . |										
|He would never feel powerless again . |	DEFAULT									
|His father had told him , `` An oath is the measure of the man who gives it . '' |	Logan	Regnus Gyre								
|Logan had seen what happened when he did what he knew was right , no matter how foolish it looked at the time . |										
|That was what rallied the Holers around him . |	Logan									
|That was what had saved his life when he was feverish and barely conscious . |										
|That was what had made Lilly -- the woman the Khalidorans crafted into the ferali -- turn on the Khalidorans . |	Lilly									
|Ultimately , Logan 's doing what was right had saved all of Cenaria . |	Logan									
|But his father Regnus Gyre had lived by his oaths , through a miserable marriage and miserable service to a petty , wicked king . |	Logan	Regnus Gyre								
|He gritted his teeth all day and slept well every night . |										
|Logan did n't know if he was as much of a man as his father . |	Logan	Regnus Gyre								
|He could n't do it . |	Logan									
|So he hesitated . |	DEFAULT									
|If she raised her hand to order her men to attack , she would be breaking the covenant between lord and vassal . |	DEFAULT									
|If she broke it , he would be free . |	DEFAULT	DEFAULT								
|`` Our soldiers proclaimed me king . '' |	Logan									
|Logan said in a neutral tone . |										
|Lose your temper , Terah . |	Terah Graesin									
|Order the attack . |										
|Order your own death . |										
|Terah 's eyes lit , but her voice was steady and her hand did n't move . |	Terah Graesin									
|`` Men say many things in the heat of battle . |										
|I am prepared to forgive this indiscretion . '' |	DEFAULT									
|Is this what Kylar saved me for ? |										
|No . |										
|But this is the man I am . |	DEFAULT									
|I am my father 's son . |	Logan									
|Logan stood slowly so as not to alarm either side 's archers , then , slowly , he knelt and touched Terah Graesin 's feet in submission . |	Logan	Terah Graesin								
|Late that night , a band of Khalidorans attacked the Cenarian camp , killing dozens of drunken revelers before fleeing into the darkness . |										
|In the morning , Terah Graesin sent Logan Gyre and a thousand of his men to hunt them down . |
