past O
, O
and O
she O
only O
half O
listened O
to O
the O
hag O
standing O
beside O
her O

The O
girl O
's O
breath O
had O
risen O
to O
the O
pace O
of O
the O
magnificent O
horses O
. O
She O
felt O
her O
face O
burning O
, O
a O
flush O
that O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
heat O
. O
The O

The O
fishergirl O
nodded O
faintly O

As O

the O
lowborn O
, O
they O
waited O
by O
the O
roadside O
, O
the O
old O
woman O
burdened O
beneath O
a O
rough O
sack O
filled O
with O
turnips O
, O
the O
girl O
with O
a O
heavy O
basket O
balanced O
on O
her O

Every O

so O
the O
old O
woman O
shifted O
the O
sack O
from O
one O
bony O
shoulder O
to O
the O

With O
the O
riders O

them O
on O

The O
fishergirl O
wiped O
dust O
from O
her O
forehead O
. O
Her O
bright O
eyes O
darted O
among O
the O
soldiers O
passing O
before O
her O
. O
The O
young O
men O
top O
their O
high-backed O
saddles O
held O
expressions O
stern O
and O
fixed O
straight O
ahead O
. O
The O
few O
women O
who O
rode O
among O
them O
sat O
tall O
and O
somehow O
fiercer O
than O
the O
men O
. O
The O
sunset O
cast O
red O
glints O
from O
their O
helms O
, O
flashing O
so O
that O
the O
girl O
's O
eyes O
stung O
and O
her O
vision O
blurred O

` O
You O

' O
Slowly O
the O
fishergirl O
realized O
that O
a O
question O
had O
been O
asked O
of O
her O
. O
She O
pulled O
her O
attention O
from O
the O
soldiers O
and O
smiled O
down O
at O
the O
old O
woman O
. O
` O
I O

she O
said O
, O
` O

' O
Rigga O
raised O
her O
voice O

' O
I O

She O
smiled O
again O
and O
swept O
her O
gaze O
back O
to O
the O
soldiers O
. O
` O
Is O

it O

' O
she O
breathed O
. O
Rigga O

hand O
shot O
out O
and O
snagged O
the O
girl O

thick O
black O
hair O
, O
yanked O
it O
hard O
. O
The O
girl O
cried O
out O
. O
The O
basket O
on O
her O
head O
lurched O
, O
then O
slid O
down O
on O
to O
one O
shoulder O
. O
She O
grabbed O
frantically O
for O
it O

it O
was O
too O
heavy O
. O
The O
basket O
struck O
the O
ground O
and O
split O
apart O

` O
Aaai O

the O
girl O
gasped O

But O
Rigga O
pulled O

snapped O
her O

around O

` O

The O

The O

on O

at O

Across O

' O
a O
voice O

Rigga O
swung O
to O
face O
the O
road O

An O
outrider O
had O
slowed O
his O
mount O

The O
Seer O
released O

girl O
staggered O
back O

step O

A O
rock O
on O

fell O

When O

looked O
up O

thundered O
up O

this O
one O
growled O
, O

as O
he O
rode O
by O
he O
leaned O
in O
his O
saddle O
and O
swung O
an O
open O
, O
gauntleted O
hand O
. O
The O
iron-scaled O
glove O
cracked O
against O
Rigga O

head O
, O
spinning O
her O
around O
. O
She O
toppled O
. O
The O
fishergirl O
screamed O
as O
Rigga O
landed O
heavily O
across O
her O
thighs O
. O
A O
thread O
of O
crimson O
spit O
spattered O
her O
face O

Whimpering O
, O
the O
girl O
pushed O
herself O
back O
across O
the O
gravel O
, O
then O
used O
her O
feet O
to O
shove O
away O
Rigga O
's O
body O
. O
She O
climbed O
to O
her O
knees O
. O
Something O
within O
Rigga O
's O
prophecy O
seemed O
lodged O
in O
the O
girl O
's O
head O
, O
heavy O
as O
a O
stone O
and O
hidden O
from O
light O
. O
She O
found O

could O
not O
retrieve O
a O
single O
word O

Seer O
had O
said O
. O
She O
reached O
out O
and O
grasped O
Rigga O

woollen O
shawl O

Carefully O
, O
she O
rolled O
the O
old O
woman O
over O

Blood O
covered O

side O
of O

head O

running O
down O

More O
blood O
smeared O
her O
lined O
chin O

stained O
her O
mouth O

eyes O
stared O
sightlessly O
. O
The O
fishergirl O
pulled O
back O
, O
unable O
to O
catch O
her O
breath O
. O
Desperate O
, O
she O
looked O
about O
. O
The O
column O
of O
soldiers O
had O
passed O
, O
leaving O
nothing O
but O
dust O
and O
the O
distant O
tremble O
of O
hoofs O

bag O

spilled O
on O

five O

girl O
managed O

ragged O
lungful O
of O

air O

Wiping O
her O
nose O

looked O
to O

` O
Never O

in O

crawled O
towards O
the O
bundles O
of O
twine O
that O
had O
fallen O
from O
the O
breached O
basket O

when O

spoke O
again O

almost O
gone O

unseasonal O
chill O
bled O

grated O
softly O

in O
a O
voice O

hit O

The O
fishergirl O
stumbled O
over O
to O
Rigga O

bag O
and O
picked O
up O
a O
candle O
. O
She O
straightened O
, O
her O
eyes O
suddenly O
hard O
, O
then O
deliberately O
spat O
on O
to O
the O
road O

The O
shorter O
man O

head O
snapped O
towards O
her O
. O
Within O
the O
hood O

seemed O
the O
shadows O
played O
alone O

The O
girl O
shrank O
back O

step O
. O
` O
It O

the O

still O
at O

softly O

Calling O
for O
her O
. O
' O
Tears O
filled O
the O
girl O
's O
eyes O
. O
A O
wordless O
anguish O
seemed O
to O
well O
up O
from O
that O
black O
stone O
in O
her O
mind O
. O
She O
wiped O
her O
cheeks O
. O
` O
Where O
did O
you O
come O
from O
? O
' O
she O
asked O
abruptly O
. O
` O
We O
did O

see O
you O
on O
the O
road O

' O
The O
man O
beside O

half O
turned O
to O
the O
gravel O
track O

` O
On O
the O

side O
, O
' O
he O
said O

a O
smile O
in O

tone O

` O
On O
the O

side O
indeed O
. O
' O
He O
faced O
down O
the O
road O
again O
and O
raised O
his O
arms O
. O
The O
girl O
drew O
in O
a O
sharp O
breath O
as O
darkness O
descended O
. O
A O
loud O
, O
tearing O
sound O
filled O
the O
air O
for O
a O
second O
, O
then O
the O
darkness O
dissipated O
and O
the O
girl O
's O
eyes O
widened O
. O
Seven O
massive O
Hounds O
now O
sat O
around O
the O
man O
in O
the O
road O
. O
The O
eyes O
of O
these O
beasts O
glowed O
yellow O
, O
and O
all O
were O
turned O
in O
the O

direction O
as O
the O
man O
himself O

heard O
him O
hiss O
, O

Then O
go O
! O
' O
Silently O
, O
the O
Hounds O
bolted O
down O

road O

Their O
master O
turned O
and O
said O
to O
the O
man O
beside O
her O
, O
` O
Something O
to O
gnaw O
on O
Laseen I-PERSON

mind O

' O
He O
giggled O
again O
. O
` O
Must O
you O

the O

answered O
wearily O
. O
The O
short O
man O
stiffened O
. O
` O
They O
are O
within O

of O
the O
column O

' O
He O
cocked O
his O
head O
. O
From O
up O
the O
road O
came O
the O
scream O
of O
horses O

sighed O

quietly O

The O

bit O
her O
lip O

Still O
clutching O

candle O
, O
she O
took O
another O
step O
back O

darting O
from O

cleared O
his O

, O
` O
It O

Faintly O

above O

came O
the O
shrieks O
of O

a O
sound O
that O
pierced O

heart O

darted O
to O

motionless O
form O
on O
the O

back O

thought O
to O
run O

her O
legs O

weakened O

came O
close O

to O
study O

again O

the O
fishergirl O
said O
quickly O
. O

hesitated O
at O
her O
strange O
comment O
, O
then O
he O
shrugged O
. O
The O
shadows O
whirled O
out O
to O
engulf O
the O
girl O
. O
With O
their O
cold O
touch O
her O
mind O
fell O
away O
, O
down O
into O
darkness O
. O
Her O
last O
fleeting O
sensation O
was O
of O
the O
soft O
wax O
of O
the O
candle O
in O
her O
right O
hand O
, O
and O
how O
it O
seemed O
to O
well O
up O
between O
the O
fingers O
of O
her O
clenched O
fist O
. O
The O
captain O
shifted O
in O
his O
saddle O
and O
glanced O
at O
the O
woman O
riding O
beside O
him O
. O
` O
We O
've O
closed O
the O
road O

both O
sides O

inland O

far O
, O
no O
word O

leaked O

wiped O
sweat O
from O
his O
brow O
and O
winced O
. O
The O
hot O
woollen O
cap O
beneath O
his O
helm O
had O
rubbed O
his O
forehead O
raw O
. O
` O
Something O
wrong O
, O
Captain O
? O
' O
He O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
squinting O
up O
the O
road O
. O
` O
Helmet O
's O
loose O
. O
Had O
more O
hair O
the O
last O
time O
I O
wore O
it O
. O
' O
The I-PERSON
Adjunct O
to O
the O
Empress I-PERSON
did O
not O
reply O
. O
The O
mid-morning O
sun O
made O
the O
road O
's O
white O
, O
dusty O
surface O
almost O
blinding O
. O
The O
captain O
felt O
sweat O
running O
down O
his O
body O
, O
and O
the O
mail O
of O
his O
helm O
's O
lobster O
tail O
kept O
nipping O
the O
hairs O
on O
his O
neck O
. O
Already O
his O
lower O
back O
ached O
. O
It O
had O
been O
years O
since O
he O
'd O
last O
ridden O
a O
horse O
, O
and O
the O
roll O
was O
slow O
in O
coming O
. O
With O
every O
saddle-bounce O
he O
felt O
vertebrae O
crunch O
. O
It O
had O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
somebody O
's O
title O
had O
been O
enough O
to O
straighten O
him O
up O
. O
But O
this O
was O
the O
Adjunct O
to O
the O
Empress O
, O
Laseen O
's O
personal O
servant O
, O
an O
extension O
of O
her O
Imperial O
will O
. O
The O
last O
thing O
the O
captain O
wanted O
was O
to O
show O
his O
misery O
to O
this O
young O
, O
dangerous O
woman O
. O
Up O
ahead O
the O
road O
began O
its O
long O
, O
winding O
ascent O
. O
A O
salty O
wind O
blew O
from O
their O
left O
, O
whistling O
through O
the O
newly O
budding O
trees O
lining O
that O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O
By O
mid-afternoon O
, O
that O
wind O
would O
breathe O
hot O
as O
a O
baker O
's O
oven O
, O
carrying O
with O
it O
the O
stench O
of O
the O
mudflats O
. O
And O
the O
sun O
's O
heat O
would O
bring O
something O
else O
as O
well O
. O
The O
captain O
hoped O
to O
be O
back O
in O
Kan O
by O
then O
. O
He O
tried O
not O
to O
think O
about O
the O
place O
they O
rode O
towards O
. O
Leave O
that O
to O
the O
Adjunct O
. O
In O
his O
years O
of O
service O
to O
the O
Empire O
, O
he O
'd O
seen O
enough O
to O
know O
when O
to O
shut O
everything O
down O
inside O
his O
skull O
